Meet the 2026 Moto G and Moto G Play. Earlier this year, I reviewed the 2025 Moto G and was impressed by the value it packed into a $200 device. It seems to me that this experience will carry over to the upcoming devices.\n\nAlso: The best Motorola phones of 2025\n\nAt a glance, the 2026 Moto G looks identical to the 2025 model. It features a 6.7-inch, 120Hz touchscreen, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5G connectivity, and RAM Boost for enhanced performance. You'll also find a 50MP wide-angle camera returning for the new generation. It appears that all the major changes for the 2026 model are internal.\n\nThat 50MP lens will be supported by Motorola's \"Quad Pixel Technology,\" which the company states allows the 2026 Moto G to deliver \"sharper, more vibrant results, even in tricky lighting situations.\" It'll even have a new \"dedicated Macro Vision camera\" for upclose shots. On the front will be a 32MP selfie lens, a solid upgrade from the 16GB camera used on the previous generation.\n\nThe other major change is the bigger 5,200 mAh battery. Motorola states that the 2026 Moto G is capable of lasting up to two days straight. However, based on my experience with last year's Moto G, I believe there's a good chance it can run for even longer with light use.\n\nOther notable features for the upcoming Moto G refresh include an IP52 resistance rating and support for 30W TurboPower charging. The smartphone will be available for purchase on Motorola's website starting December 11 for $200. It'll arrive in two colors: Pantone Slipstream (grey) and Pantone Cattleya Orchid (purple).\n\nIf you're looking for something more affordable, the Moto G Play will be up your alley. It shares many of the same features as its counterpart, sporting a 6.7-inch display, a 5,200 mAh battery, and a 50MP rear lens, but pares back a few things. For example, the Moto G Play doesn't have a 32MP selfie lens, opting instead for an 8MP option. The device supports TurboPower as well, but instead of 30W, this phone only supports a charging speed of 18W.\n\nAlso: A power bank that doubles as an LTE hotspot is the travel gadget I didn't know I needed\n\nIt's not all downgrades. The Moto G Play features a unique set of AI enhancements for its cameras, including Night Vision, Auto Smile Capture, and Portrait modes. Motorola's Moto G Play is set to launch on November 13 through the company's digital storefront, Amazon, and Best Buy, for $170. It'll be available in a single color: Pantone  Tapestry (deep blue).\n\nThere's still a lot that we don't know about either smartphone, including which chipset Motorola is using this time. The 2025 model was powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300. It's possible that the same hardware will be used, but I don't think so, since the MediaTek Dimensity 6400 has been around since February.\n\nI believe Motorola will pick the 6400, but we won't know for sure until the release date.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Update newsletter .\n\nInside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream\n\nSo long, SaaS: Why AI spells the end of per-seat software licenses - and what comes next\n\nBest early Black Friday deals 2025: I'm tracking over 40 of my favorite discounts live now\n\nAnother European agency shifts off Big Tech, as digital sovereignty movement gains steam"

    "full_text": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nSLES 16 comes with model context protocol built in.\n\nThe new enterprise distro is digital sovereignty-ready.\n\nThis impressive upgrade introduces many changes and new features.\n\nLots of companies are announcing AI this and AI that, but few of them offer more than new AI lipstick on an old pig when you look at them closely. Then, there's what SUSE is doing with its release of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16 (SLES 16) , available today. This new version is positioned as an AI-ready operating system tailored to the demands of today's hybrid cloud, data center, and edge computing environments.\n\nAlso: You can get Nvidia's CUDA on three popular enterprise Linux distros now - why it matters\n\nSLES 16's most significant AI component is a technology preview of a built-in model context protocol (MCP) host. MCP has become the agentic generation of AI-powered applications. Developed as an open standard by Anthropic in late 2024 , MCP is built to seamlessly and securely connect large language models (LLMs) and AI agents to the vast, ever-changing landscape of real-world data, tools, and services.\n\nAdditionally, the release features built-in support for GPU acceleration, the latest Nvidia CUDA toolkit , and enhanced container and Kubernetes management for large-scale, compute-intensive deployments. In short, it's an AI-ready Linux distribution.\n\nIn addition, SUSE  is backing this new release up with its Sovereign Premium Support (SPS) package . This comprehensive support service is designed to meet the growing demand for digital sovereignty.  Specifically, SPS is designed for enterprises and organizations that require strict data residency, privacy, and operational control within the EU. The service ensures that:\n\nAll support personnel and data are based in the EU, with named premium support engineers and service delivery managers assigned to each customer.\n\nCustomer support data is stored exclusively on EU-located networks and servers, addressing both regulatory and geopolitical concerns.\n\nAccess to sensitive data is strictly limited to EU-based staff, with a commitment to encrypting all data required for troubleshooting.\n\nTo reinforce sovereignty, SUSE has partnered with Exoscale , a leading European cloud provider, allowing businesses to deploy SLES on Exoscale's secure, EU-compliant cloud environment. This effort will enable organizations to maintain local data control while leveraging trusted, open-source solutions. As Exoscale CEO  Mathias Nöbauer explained, \"Digital sovereignty is no longer a niche requirement; it's a fundamental business necessity for European companies. \"\n\nSUSE has also allied with AI & Partners to support compliance with the EU AI Act , combining infrastructure and regulatory technology for sectors such as finance and healthcare. \"Beneath the surface of any AI platform lies the infrastructure of trust: secure infrastructure and auditable operations. That is what powers safe, cloud native AI,\" said Abhinav Puri, SUSE's VP and GM of Portfolio Solutions and Services.\n\nAlso: I tested 3 Snapdragon X Windows laptops this year - and found 3 big issues\n\nFinally, SUSE has joined the EuroStack initiative . This is a policy and funding coalition focused on developing European digital infrastructure, encompassing cloud, AI, and connectivity platforms. This move aligns SUSE with the broader EU strategy for open-source-based digital sovereignty.\n\nWhile all this should catch the attention of anyone who values digital sovereignty or wants to run AI on their own hardware, SLES 16 may have the most dramatic changes of any SLES release to date.\n\nIt starts with the installation. SUSE has finally dropped its YaST installer for the new Agama installer . Agama enables local and remote deployment via browser, is written in Rust for enhanced memory safety, and maintains compatibility with AutoYaST profiles for seamless migration from existing AutoYaST profiles.\n\nAlso: 5 obscure Linux distros you've probably never heard of - but should definitely try\n\nSLES 16 also debuts its new Adaptable Linux Platform , which separates the host Linux from the application layer. This is being done to avoid the age-old Linux problem of dependency hell .  Within its decoupling of applications and their dependencies from the operating system, you can use the latest version, even the beta, if you need it for development, while continuing to support old versions of your application on a more stable version for production. This also enables simplified updates and better consistency in deployment across diverse environments.\n\nThe new distro has also adopted the UsrEtc model for configuration files. That means distributor defaults now reside in /usr, while local administrator customizations now live in /etc/example.conf.d/*.conf. This separation makes updates cleaner and finally eliminates the long-standing problem of managing .rpmsave and .rpmnew files.\n\nThere have also been significant changes to SLES's default programs:\n\nNetworking: NetworkManager is now the sole networking stack, replacing wicked.\n\nFirewall: NFTables is now the default, replacing IPTables.\n\nDHCP: KEA DHCP replaces the older ISC DHCP server.\n\nVirtualization: SLES 16 focuses exclusively on KVM as the general-purpose hypervisor. The Xen hypervisor has been removed.\n\nKey-value store: Valkey , the community-driven fork, replaces Redis.\n\nDisplay server: Wayland replaces the X.org server as the default, though support for X11 applications remains.\n\nThe latest SLES also boasts a new security approach. SLES 16 has transitioned from AppArmor to SELinux as the default mandatory access control (MAC) framework, with SELinux enabled in enforcing mode by default. The new SLES's SELinux comes with over 440 policy modules, allowing you to get started with ready-to-run, robust coverage for your enterprise security needs.\n\nAlso: The easiest way to protect your Linux PC from disaster - no backup needed\n\nSLES 16 also features post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. This proactively protects data against \"Harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks, where adversaries may store encrypted data today to decrypt it with quantum computers in the future. (If you don't think you need to worry about this, think again. It will happen. And it may not take that long.)\n\nLinux also has new management tools. For hands-on server management, SLES 16 has shifted from YaST2 to Cockpit . System administrators from the Red Hat universe will recognize Cockpit at a glance, but new users should know it's an easy-to-use, web-based, remote management console. To make it easier for longtime SUSE admins, Cockpit has been updated to seamlessly manage SLES-specific functions such as software repositories, package installation, and SUSE subscriptions.\n\nSUSE is also extending automatic snapshot integration into Cockpit. With every update performed using the Zypper package manager or Cockpit, a new snapshot will be created, and the system will maintain them to ensure that system changes can always be rolled back.\n\nAlso: This Linux distro makes openSUSE accessible to all - even newbies should take a look\n\nAt the DevOps level above this, SLES 16 now includes Ansible . Yes, that's also a Red Hat-based automation framework. SUSE is shipping it with standardized Ansible roles for consistent SLES configuration. This includes roles for firewalls, SELinux, the Podman container manager, and related services. Prefer Salt for your DecOps needs? Salt remains fully supported via SUSE Multi-Linux Manager .\n\nIf you work at a company that dislikes moving from one version of the operating system to another, SLES 16 comes with a 16-year support promise. Each minor version now receives five years of support. Specifically, each will come with two years of general support, followed by three years of optional long-term support. The major version as a whole is backed by 10 years of mainstream support plus six years of extended service, allowing customers to align upgrade cycles with hardware refreshes and regulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally, SUSE's vocabulary has evolved. Moving forward, Service Packs (SPs) are now Minor Releases and Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS) is now Long Term Support (LTS). This aligns with how other Linux distributions describe the evolution of their releases.\n\nAlso: The best CRM software: Streamline your customer relationships\n\nAdditionally, for long-term support, SLES 16 is fully prepared to extend beyond 2038. The 32-bit time_t counter overflow issue, known as the \" Y2038 problem ,\" has been addressed by updating key components and interfaces, including lastlog, utmp, and systemd-logind.\n\nWhen I consider the entire package, I'm impressed. SUSE has gone out of its way to create a new opinionated enterprise Linux distribution that embraces modern software. If you haven't evaluated SLES recently for your server, cloud, and edge needs, it's time to take another look. I think you'll be impressed too.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter .\n\nWhy Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\n\nApple quietly makes running Linux containers easier on Macs\n\nCan't upgrade to Windows 11?

    "full_text": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nBusiness leaders are discovering that the traditional playbook for sales productivity is failing, and businesses need to shift their focus from raw output to genuine effectiveness.\n\nTo understand this evolution, SpiceWorks' Head Brand Ambassador, Jeff Gretler, and Maria Groeschel, Global Head of Commercial Strategy and Operations at Dropbox, discussed the rising challenges and needs for innovation in sales today in a 30-minute Executive 1-on-1 video for SpiceWorks.\n\nOne of the top problems affecting sales reps today isn't a lack of speed; it's the fragmentation of their tools and information. Groeschel noted that the intense pressure for deep personalization and value-add engagement forces reps to consult numerous systems for a single customer view, often navigating ten or more different platforms.\n\nAlso: 5 must-have cloud tools for small businesses in 2025 (and my top 10 money-saving secrets)\n\nThese disconnected systems compel sales reps to spend valuable time manually searching for information and trying to gain context from disparate sources, such as Slack, Salesforce, Google Docs, and Gong notes. This creates a significant time tax that pulls from high-value activities.\n\nGrettler said, \"Single system-itis used to be something that was actually worse. Now it's business sprawl. There are tools and data everywhere. And we need ways to not only know where that data is, but a way to connect that and actually be able to use it efficiently.\"\n\nWhile traditional metrics, such as pipeline growth and deal velocity, are still important, many businesses are now focusing on rep effectiveness. This pivot to rep effectiveness is a strategic response to a market that no longer rewards speed over substance.\n\nThe modern buyer's demand for deeper personalization necessitates a new approach to measuring what truly matters. As Groeschel puts it, the focus must be on impact. \"We all know deals are not won in isolation. They are won when teams are actually moving together.\"\n\nBut cross-functional alignment across sales, customer success, marketing, product, and other teams frequently breaks down. This failure isn't due to a lack of effort, but because teams are not working from the same context, as priorities move at different speeds in their respective areas.\n\nThe solution lies in creating a unified, shared space where all teams operate from the same up-to-date information. Tools like Dropbox Dash make it possible for reps to instantly see health signals from customer success or access the latest product positioning from marketing.\n\nInstead of imposing a new process, these tools connect to the applications and platforms reps already use, improving their existing day-to-day environment. This approach removes friction and makes adoption feel natural, simplifying the path to better habits.\n\nAlso: 8 ways to make responsible AI part of your company's DNA\n\nEvery sales organization has stories of deals saved at the last minute by the extraordinary efforts of a few individuals. While commendable, a business model that relies on these heroics is unsustainable and inefficient.\n\nThese last-ditch efforts are often a symptom of a broken process. As Grettler notes, this kind of effort is frequently a \"herculean task just to get you to a baseline,\" rather than achieving breakthrough success. Groeschel framed the core challenge by asking: \"Does it get us to a point where we no longer have to rely on heroics in the final hour?\"\n\nThe ultimate objective is to build scalable, repeatable systems that enable consistent success without the need for constant, last-minute firefighting.\n\nGroeschel summarized this approach with a three-part framework: effectiveness over raw activity, productivity that creates value, and a commitment to intelligent, intentional efficiency. By connecting fragmented workflows and bringing context to sales tasks, businesses can transform wasted motion into meaningful progress.\n\nTo hear the full discussion and gain deeper insights into improving sales effectiveness, watch the SpiceWorks Executive 1-on-1 video here .\n\nInside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream\n\nSo long, SaaS: Why AI spells the end of per-seat software licenses - and what comes next\n\nBest early Black Friday deals 2025: I'm tracking over 40 of my favorite discounts live now\n\nAnother European agency shifts off Big Tech, as digital sovereignty movement gains steam"

I typically even shrug off battery life as secondary (especially when a pair produces brilliant sound).\n\nEvery once in a great while, however, I receive a pair of earbuds or headphones that don't quite live up to my standards for audio. When that happens, I at least attempt to find something of value in the device.\n\nAlso: This $99 pair of earbuds made me forget about the expensive ones - how they win\n\nSuch was the case when I received the OpenRock Linux 20 open-air earbuds . After unpacking them and connecting them to my Pixel 9 Pro, I fired up my favorite playlist and tapped play.\n\nI was immediately disappointed. The sound was tinny, flat, lacked bass, had zero agility in the low end, and the highs were pretty much non-existent.\n\nBut then, I realized that these earbuds might serve a better purpose. \"Hears\" how that went.\n\nThese earbuds sound great for phone calls and podcasts.\n\nApple AirPods Max ANC Wireless Headphones (USB-C Charging, Blue) : $500 (save $50)\n\nSoundcore Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones (Black) : $40 (save $20)\n\nBeats Studio Pro Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones (Black) : $250 (save $101)\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-Ear Headphones : $278 (save $70)\n\nSennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless ANC Over-Ear Headphones (Black) : $300 (save $80)\n\nThe \"gimmick\" with the Link 20 earbuds is a detachable, flexible mic boom, which is just under three inches long and is held in place by two magnets.\n\nAt first blush, I didn't bother with it, but once I realized music sounded less than average, I decided to look at the Link 20 earbuds from a different angle: phone calls.\n\nAlso: The best wireless earbuds: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nSo, I put them to the test. I called someone who knows what I do for a living and informed them that they were part of my test. I asked them how I sounded and their answer was simple: tinny but very clear. We spoke for a few minutes, and then I switched from the Link 20 earbuds to my Denon PerL Pro earbuds (which are the best earbuds I've ever tested - by a long shot).\n\nThe detachable mic boom can be placed on either the right or left earbud.\n\nI honestly assumed the person on the other end of the call would say something to the tune of, \"That's much better.\" Instead, they informed me that the first pair of earbuds sounded clearer. Honestly, I was surprised. I was certain the Denon earbuds would produce superior sound to the Link 20 earbuds. After all, the sound from PearL Pro earbuds is worlds apart from the Link 20 earbuds.\n\nAnd even though the Link 20 earbuds sounded tinny to the listener, they found that I was much clearer and easier to understand.\n\nNow, given that the OpenRock Link 20 earbuds sell for $149, I would have thought their sound would at least compare to most mid-range earbuds, but that was not the case. Even after installing the OpenRock app, I found no way to improve the sound.\n\nAlso: One of my favorite open-ear headphones just hit an all-time low price\n\nAccording to the app, the OpenRock Link 20 has different modes, and it took me a moment to figure that out. If you look at the gesture section, you'll see that a triple-tap of the left earbud button is supposed to cycle between modes.\n\nAt first, I couldn't get it to work, but then I thought, \"Maybe if I remove the mic boom?\" As soon as I did that, I could then switch between Music, Beast, and Custom modes. It took me a bit of work, but I was able to at least get the earbuds to sound in line with lower mid-range devices. I found Music Mode to be the best option, but Spatial Sound mode enabled gave it a sort of flanger effect, which was not good.\n\nI tried to use the Custom mode, which allowed me to adjust the 7-band EQ, but no matter what I did with the EQ, I couldn't get the sound I wanted. Because of that, I went back to basic Music Mode and accepted the idea that the Link 20 earbuds leaned far too heavily into the midrange (which gives it the tinny sound).\n\nNow, why would I not have written these off immediately? Midrange is where the human voice lives. It's why any time you see EQ adjusted for things like podcasts, you'll notice the mids are elevated. Because of that, anything with voice sounds very clear on the Link 20 earbuds.\n\nThat leads me to the other bonus with these earbuds: podcasts. They sound fantastic on the Link 20, with vocals that can be heard to perfection. At the same time, YouTube videos sound equally as good. I listened to John Oliver's latest and was so happy to hear his voice without compromise.\n\nThe earbuds still lack bass, so there isn't as much resonance as I prefer, but I'll happily exchange bass for clarity when listening to podcasts and video.\n\nIf you need a pair of earbuds for phone calls or podcasts, the OpenRock Link 20 earbuds are a great option. If, on the other hand, music is your priority, the Link 20 earbuds will disappoint.\n\nFor over a year, I've grabbed my higher-end earbuds for phone calls, but now I'll gladly default to the likes of the Link 20 earbuds any time I need to place or receive a call.\n\nAlso: These discounted earbuds deliver audio so high quality, you'll forget they're mid-range\n\nWeight: 0.3 oz per earbud\n\nAudio Drivers: 15 x 10 mm custom dynamic drivers\n\nFrequency Response: 20 Hz to 20 kHz\n\nMicrophone: 5-mic with AI ENC noise cancellation\n\nAAC and SBC codec support\n\nConnectivity Bluetooth: 6.0 with a range: 50 ft indoors, 99 ft outdoors\n\nWaterproofing: IPX7 waterproof - Boom Mic: IP55 dust and water resistance\n\nBattery Music Playback: Up to 13 hours per charge (52 hours with case)\n\nTalk Time: Up to 9 hours per charge (36 hours with case)\n\nCharging: Quick charge feature provides 1 hour of playback with a 5-minute charge\n\nI compared the M5 MacBook Pro to older models, and it made my $2,500 M1 Max weep\n\nI wore the Oakley Meta Vanguard on a 5-mile walk - here's who should (and who shouldn't) buy them\n\nI compared the Sony Bravia 8 II to competing OLED TVs, and it settled my buying decision\n\nAfter using M5 iPad Pro, I'm seriously considering putting away my MacBook for it"

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form .\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nYou can completely disable Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Drive, and more.\n\nGoogle Photos has separate Gemini settings you must turn off, too.\n\nChrome users can also disable Gemini directly in browser settings.\n\nAre you frustrated by Google's insistence on injecting Gemini into everything? While some do enjoy Google's latest AI tools and smart features, which seem to roll out every week, others might prefer things the way they were before.\n\nAlso: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude\n\nIf that's you, you'll be happy to know there's a way out.\n\nGoogle somewhat buries a Gemini toggle in settings. If you know where to look, you can find it and turn off Gemini in Gmail, Google Docs, Google Photos, and every other Google product you know and love. Here's how.\n\nGo to your Gmail account on the web , as it's the easiest place to turn it off. You can also do this through other Google Workspace apps like Drive or Calendar via settings, but Gmail is the most straightforward.\n\nGo to Gmail. Make sure you're logged in with your Google account.\n\nOpen settings. Look for the Settings cog (gear icon), and click it.\n\nSelect All Settings. At the top of the settings pane, click All Settings.\n\nFind Smart Features. Under the General tab, scroll down until you see \"Google Workspace smart features.\"\n\nClick \"Manage Workspace smart feature settings.\" This will open controls for Google's smart features.\n\nAlso: Gemini can access your Android phone's other apps, unless you stop it - here's how\n\nOnce you're there, you'll see two toggles (pictured above):\n\nThe top toggle is for smart features in Google Workspace products (like Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.). When you turn this setting on, you agree to let Gemini \"summarize content, create drafts, and find key information.\"\n\nThe bottom toggle is for other Google products that interact with your Workspace data (like Maps or Wallet). When you turn this setting on, you agree to get \"suggestions and answers in the Gemini app.\"\n\nOther examples are listed for both, but we're here for the Google Workspace smart features. Toggle that one off.\n\nAlso: Google reveals how much energy a Gemini query uses - in industry first\n\nIf you want to be thorough, disable the bottom toggle for \"other Google products\" as well. Just keep in mind that turning that one off removes Gemini assistance across all Google products, along with other convenient features like automatic calendar entries and smart suggestions, since they're bundled together.\n\nWhen I disabled smart features in Workspace products, the little Gemini icons were still visible, like the \"Help me write\" button. But clicking any of them prompted Google to ask me to turn smart features back on to re-enable Gemini. I didn't see any AI-generated summaries or Gemini-powered suggestions across my apps.\n\nFrom what I could tell, Gemini was gone entirely -- with a couple of exceptions.\n\nOne exception I found was Google Photos.\n\nEven after disabling Google Workspace smart features through Gmail, the Ask Gemini function in the Photos app (often just called Ask Photos) continued to work normally, along with a few other smart features. It turns out Google Photos has its own separate settings you'll need to turn off. Here's how to find them:\n\nIn the Photos mobile app, tap your profile icon.\n\nGo to Google Photos Settings > Preferences > Gemini features in Photos.\n\nTurn off the option labeled \" Use Gemini in Photos .\" It should disable all the Gemini features in Photos, including \"Search with Ask Photos\" and \"Gemini-powered memories.\"\n\nYou may be asked to confirm you want to turn off Gemini in Photos.\n\nAlso: I tried Google Photos' AI search and it was surprisingly bad - 3 ways to fix it\n\nOnce I did this, the classic Google Photos experience -- including the old search bar -- became my only option, with the AI \"Ask\" feature disappeared.\n\nGemini in Chrome is rolling out gradually and isn't available to everyone yet. To use it, you must be 18 or older, in the US, and signed in to the latest English (US) version of Chrome on a Mac or Windows computer.\n\nAlso: Gemini arrives in Chrome - here's everything it can do now\n\nGemini in Chrome lets you chat with Google's AI directly from your browser through a floating window, where you can ask questions, summarize articles, or get personalized help as you browse. After opting in, you can even connect Google Workspace apps so Gemini can summarize emails, add tasks, or create calendar events. If you're not cool with all that and have decided to disable Gemini in your browser, open Chrome and go to More (three-dot icon) > Settings > AI innovations. Click each of the options below and toggle them off:\n\nHistory search, powered by AI\n\nSome people are concerned about privacy, performance issues, or frustration with AI inaccuracies, while others simply prefer things the way they were before Gemini. Either way, it's good to know Google gives you a way to opt out of Gemini across its most popular apps, even if the settings are a bit hidden and buried in a few places. I personally felt a wave of relief once I switched it off.\n\nAlso: I looked into the most popular AI apps, and the runner-up caught me by surprise\n\nNo more unwanted AI assistance, things are back to normal, and I'm in control of my Google apps.\n\nIt's optional. In the same settings panel found in Gmail, you can toggle off \"Other Google products,\" which disables Gemini suggestions across apps like Maps and Wallet, but it may also remove conveniences like smart calendar entries.\n\nIcons for smart features such as \"Help me write\" may still be visible, but clicking them should prompt you to re-enable \"Google Workspace smart features\" in settings. If the toggle is off, Gemini won't run.\n\nOf course. Just return to the Google Workspace smart features settings, and toggle them back on at any time.\n\nZDNET has a separate guide that details all the ways you can get back to classic Google Search .\n\nWant more stories about AI?

When put to great use, it, too, gets cluttered.\n\nBy continually using your Galaxy Watch , regularly switching between apps and functionalities, or running too many apps at the same time, you're bogging it down with data that clutters it and slows performance. This results in slower performance, frozen screens, and an annoying user experience.\n\nAlso: I wore the best smartwatches from Samsung, Apple, and Google - here's how Galaxy Watch 8 wins\n\nLuckily, hope isn't lost -- and you don't need to buy another device to fix this issue. In fact, I'd advise against doing so whenever you're confronting any performance issue with your technology. Before you shell out more money on a new device, there are some tips and tricks you can use to breathe new life into an old one.\n\nThis brings us to, quite possibly, the easiest fix to lagging smartwatch performance: clearing the cache.\n\nThink of a cache like a garbage can. It temporarily stores your smartwatch data (or junk) and, in this half-baked analogy, considers that data when you log into sites or perform regular tasks.\n\nJust like a garbage can, it gets filled with junk after a while and begins to overflow if not properly handled. You eventually have to dispose of the junk in a dumpster to add more junk (or data) to the can.\n\nClearing your cache removes some of that junk that's making the garbage can (Galaxy Watch) performance laggy.\n\nAlso: Why I recommend this Samsung Galaxy Watch over competing Androids\n\nAccording to a Samsung spokesperson, the Galaxy Watch's memory management operates automatically through system-driven optimization. However, you can still take manual steps to clear the watch's memory.\n\nTo close all recent apps on your Galaxy Watch, swipe up from the watch face and tap the Recent apps icon. From there, select Close all.\n\nIf you want to manage apps running in the background, open the Recent apps screen again and tap Active in background. You can then select the specific app you want to close.\n\nTo optimize your phone's performance, go to Settings, select Device Care, and then tap Memory. From there, you can choose Clean Now to free up space.\n\nIt's best practice to occasionally clear your Galaxy Watch's cache, especially if you notice performance slowdowns or hiccups. The process is straightforward and quick, but it should make a noticeable difference in how your watch performs afterward.\n\nIf your watch is buggy, laggy, or draining battery faster than normal, clearing the cache can remove corrupted or outdated files, one Reddit user explains . The Reddit user also explains that there are certain circumstances when you should avoid cache-clearing, like right after a software update, when the smartwatch is already using extra compute power to rebuild the cache.\n\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\n\nRestarting your watch could remove some bugs and glitches.

    "full_text": "Fixing climate change is no small task — just ask carbon removal developers like Mitti Labs .\n\nThe New York-based startup has developed technology to measure how much methane is released by rice paddies and uses it to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in climate-friendly practices. It’s the sort of high-touch endeavor that venture capitalists typically avoid.\n\nSo how has Mitti managed to raise funding from its investors? In short: partnerships.\n\nMitti has started working with The Nature Conservancy on a partnership to promote regenerative, no-burn agriculture, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch, the latest in a string of deals that extend its reach. Mitti will use its AI-powered models to measure, report, and verify the work done by the nonprofit’s workers on the ground in India, where they’re helping farmers implement a swath of climate-friendly practices.\n\n“Most of the project operations on the ground are from locals from the villages where these projects are being implemented,” co-founder Xavier Laguarta told TechCrunch.\n\nWhile Mitti’s main operations currently focus on developing projects that reduce the amount of methane generated by rice farming, the company is working to offer more software features to third parties, he said.\n\n“We can measure Scope 3 emissions from other project developers or corporations that are working with rice farmers,” Laguarta said, referring to emissions that an organization does not directly control. “Anyone who’s already running projects on the ground, that’s sort of like a SaaS solution that we can offer them.”\n\nMitti isn’t alone in chasing the SaaS-partnership angle. Mati Carbon, which recently won the Xprize Carbon grand prize , develops measurement, reporting, and verification software for enhanced rock weathering, in which minerals spread on farm fields both remove carbon and fertilize the soil.\n\nMethane reduction projects generate carbon credits, which Mitti tracks using its software. The company takes a percentage of the credits’ sale and passes the remainder on to farmers and the community, he said. “Usually, farmers will see about a 15% improvement in their bottom line by joining our programs.” For smallholder farmers, who often teeter on the edge of profitability, such revenue can be meaningful.\n\nMitti’s software studies various signals from rice farms to determine how much methane they release throughout the growing season. Rice farming is distinct from many other types of agriculture because the fields are flooded for much of the year. This creates anaerobic, or oxygen-free conditions, in the soil, which foster the growth and metabolism of a suite of microbes that generate methane.\n\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas, warming the planet 82 times more than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Rice farming is a large source of human-caused methane emissions, contributing around 10% to 12% of the total.\n\nMitti’s main data sources come from satellite imagery and radar, which can penetrate through clouds, plants, water, and the soil to determine what’s happening underground where the microbes live. It then feeds that information into AI models trained on satellite data and the results of extensive field studies.\n\nSmallholders play a large role in agriculture in India; the average farm size is one hectare (about 2.5 acres). Monitoring each with physical equipment would be cost-prohibitive. The remotely sensed data helps keep verification costs reasonable, and the partnerships help bring climate-friendly practices to millions of farmers.\n\n“Ninety percent of rice is grown in Asia, and outside of potentially China, the majority of rice growing regions have these similar smallholder farmer dynamics,” Laguarta said. “A deep partnership that we have with the Nature Conservancy allows us to develop these tools that can then be used for a lot of other programs in the region.”\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor.\n\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com .\n\nStrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders, and opportunities to forge meaningful connections.\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue Anthony Ha\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue\n\nMeta has an AI product problem Russell Brandom\n\nMeta has an AI product problem\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla Anthony Ha\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams Julie Bort\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta Sarah Perez\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff Aisha Malik\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant Ivan Mehta\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant"

    "full_text": "Two former Harvard students are launching a pair of “always-on” AI-powered smart glasses that listen to, record, and transcribe every conversation and then display relevant information to the wearer in real time.\n\n“Our goal is to make glasses that make you super intelligent the moment you put them on,” said AnhPhu Nguyen, co-founder of Halo , a startup that’s developing the technology.\n\nOr, as his co-founder Caine Ardayfio put it, the glasses “give you infinite memory.”\n\n“The AI listens to every conversation you have and uses that knowledge to tell you what to say … kinda like IRL Cluely,” Ardayfio told TechCrunch, referring to the startup that claims to help users “cheat” on everything from job interviews to school exams.\n\n“If somebody says a complex word or asks you a question, like, ‘What’s 37 to the third power?’ or something like that, then it’ll pop up on the glasses,” Ardayfio added.\n\nArdayfio and Nguyen have raised $1 million to develop the glasses, led by Pillar VC, with support from Soma Capital, Village Global, and Morningside Venture. The glasses will be priced at $249 and will be available for preorder starting Wednesday. Ardayfio called the glasses “the first real step towards vibe thinking.”\n\nThe two Ivy League dropouts, who have since moved into their own version of the Hacker Hostel in the San Francisco Bay Area, recently caused a stir after developing a facial-recognition app for Meta’s smart Ray-Ban glasses to prove that the tech could be used to dox people . As a potential early competitor to Meta’s smart glasses, Ardayfio said Meta, given its history of security and privacy scandals, had to rein in its product in ways that Halo can ultimately capitalize on.\n\n“Meta doesn’t have a great reputation for caring about user privacy, and for them to release something that’s always there with you — which obviously brings a ton of utility — is just a huge reputational risk for them that they probably won’t take before a startup does it at scale first,” Nguyen added.\n\nAnd while Nguyen has a point, users may not yet have a good reason to trust the technology of a couple of college-aged students purporting to send people out into the world with covert recording equipment.\n\nWhile Meta’s glasses have an indicator light when their cameras and microphones are watching and listening as a mechanism to warn others that they are being recorded, Ardayfio said that the Halo glasses, dubbed Halo X, do not have an external indicator to warn people of their customers’ recording.\n\n“For the hardware we’re making, we want it to be discreet, like normal glasses,” said Ardayfio, who added that the glasses record every word, transcribe it, and then delete the audio file.\n\nPrivacy advocates are warning about the normalization of covert recording devices in public.\n\n“Small and discreet recording devices are not new,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.\n\n“In some ways, this sounds like a variation on the microphone spy pen,” said Galperin. “But I think that normalizing the use of an always-on recording device, which in many circumstances would require the user to get the consent of everyone within recording distance, eats away at the expectation of privacy we have for our conversations in all kinds of spaces.”\n\nThere are several states in the U.S. that make it illegal to covertly record conversations without the other persons’ consent. Ardayfio said they are aware of this but that it is up to their customer to obtain consent before using the glasses.\n\n“We trust our users to get consent if they are in a two-party consent state,” said Ardayfio, referring to the laws of a dozen U.S. states that require the consent of all recorded parties.\n\n“I would also be very concerned about where the recorded data is being kept, how it is being stored, and who has access to it,” Galperin added.\n\nArdayfio said Halo relies on Soniox for audio transcription, which claims to never store recordings. Nguyen claimed when the finished product is released to customers, it will be end-to-end encrypted but provided no evidence of how this would work. He also noted that Halo is aiming to get SOC 2 compliance, which means it has been independently audited and demonstrates adequate protection of customer data. A date for the completed SOC 2 compliance was not provided.\n\nStill, the two students are not new to privacy-invasive controversial projects.\n\nWhile still at Harvard last year, Ardayfio and Nguyen developed I-XRAY , a demo project that added facial-recognition capabilities to the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, demonstrating how easily the tech could be bolted onto a device not meant to identify people.\n\nThe duo never released the code behind I-XRAY, but they did test the glasses on random passersby without consent . In a demo video, Ardayfio showed the glasses detecting faces and pulling up personal information of strangers within seconds. The video featured reactions of people who were doxed.\n\nIn an interview with 404 Media, they acknowledged the risks: “Some dude could just find some girl’s home address on the train and just follow them home,” Nguyen told the tech news website.\n\nFor now, Halo X glasses only have a display and a microphone, but no camera, although the two are exploring the possibility of adding it to a future model.\n\nUsers still need to have their smartphones handy to help power the glasses and get “real time info prompts and answers to questions,” per Nguyen. The glasses, which are manufactured by another company that the startup didn’t name, are tethered to an accompanying app on the owner’s phone, where the glasses essentially outsource the computing since they don’t have enough power to do it on the device itself.\n\nUnder the hood, the smart glasses use Google’s Gemini and Perplexity as its chatbot engine, according to the two co-founders. Gemini is better for math and reasoning, whereas they use Perplexity to scrape the internet, they said.\n\nDuring an interview, TechCrunch asked if their glasses knew when the next season of “The Witcher” would come out. Responding in a way reminiscent of C-3PO, Ardayfio said: “‘The Witcher’ season four will be released on Netflix in 2025, but there’s no exact date yet.

Both the data center and the solar plant are expected to begin operations in 2027.\n\nMost of the equipment for the solar farm will be made in the U.S., according to the companies.\n\nThe new deal is the 18th such agreement signed between Meta and Silicon Ranch. The renewable developer said the deals have helped drive over $2.5 billion in investments.\n\nMeta has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity this year alone. In June, it signed a deal with developer Invenergy for several projects in Ohio, and in May it said it was working with AES to build 650 megawatts of solar in Kansas and Texas. Meta is also working in Texas with Engie and Zelestra to develop nearly 800 megawatts of additional solar capacity.\n\nLike many hyperscalers, Meta has been tapping renewables like solar for two main reasons. One, it helps the company stick to its net-zero carbon emissions pledges.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.\n\nAI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, efforts that have seen mixed results so far .\n\nPerplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots’ “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare.\n\n“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post.\n\nPerplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”\n\nCloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots.

Last month, Cloudflare announced the launch of a marketplace allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince sounded the alarm at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also launched a free tool to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI.\n\nThis is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization.\n\nLast year, news outlets, such as Wired , alleged Perplexity was plagiarizing their content . Weeks later, Perplexity’s CEO Aravind Srinivas was unable to immediately answer when asked to provide the company’s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com , via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\n\nStrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders, and opportunities to forge meaningful connections.\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue Anthony Ha\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue\n\nMeta has an AI product problem Russell Brandom\n\nMeta has an AI product problem\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla Anthony Ha\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams Julie Bort\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta Sarah Perez\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff Aisha Malik\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant Ivan Mehta\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant"

    "full_text": "American streets are incredibly dangerous for pedestrians . A San Carlos, California-based startup called Obvio thinks it can change that by installing cameras at stop signs — a solution the founders also say won’t create a panopticon.\n\nThat’s a bold claim at a time when other companies like Flock have been criticized for how its license plate-reading cameras have become a crucial tool in an overreaching surveillance state .\n\nObvio founders Ali Rehan and Dhruv Maheshwari believe they can build a big enough business without indulging those worst impulses. They’ve designed the product with surveillance and data-sharing limitations to ensure they can follow through with that claim.\n\nThey’ve found deep pockets willing to believe them, too. The company has just completed a $22 million Series A funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures. Obvio plans to use those funds to expand beyond the first five cities where it’s currently operating in Maryland.\n\nRehan and Maheshwari met while working at Motive, a company that makes dashboard cameras for the trucking industry. While there, Maheshwari told TechCrunch the pair realized “a lot of other normal passenger vehicles are awful drivers.”\n\nThe founders said they were stunned the more they looked into road safety. Not only were streets and crosswalks getting more dangerous for pedestrians, but in their eyes, the U.S. was also falling behind on enforcement.\n\n“Most other countries are actually pretty good at this,” Maheshwari said. “They have speed camera technology. They have a good culture of driving safety. The U.S. is actually one of the worst across all the modern nations.”\n\nMaheshwari and Rehan began studying up on road safety by reading books and attending conferences. They found that people in the industry gravitated toward three general solutions: education, engineering, and enforcement.\n\nIn their eyes, those approaches were often too separated from each other. It’s hard to quantify the impact of educational efforts. Local officials may try to fix a problematic intersection by, say, installing a roundabout, but that can take years of work and millions of dollars. And law enforcement can’t camp out at every stop sign.\n\nRehan and Maheshwari saw promise in combining them.\n\nThe result is a pylon (often brightly-colored) topped with a solar-powered camera that can be installed near almost any intersection. It’s designed not to blend in — part of the education and awareness aspect — and it’s also carefully engineered to be cheap and easy to install.\n\nThe on-device AI is trained to spot the worst types of stop sign or other infractions. (The company also claims on its website it can catch speeding, crosswalk violations, illegal turns, unsafe lane changes, and even distracted driving.) When one of these things happen, the system matches a car’s license plate to the state’s DMV database.\n\nAll of that information — the accuracy of the violation, the license plate — is verified by either Obvio staff or contractors before it’s sent to law enforcement, which then has to review the infractions before issuing a citation.\n\nObvio gives the tech to municipalities for free and makes money from the citations. Exactly how that citation revenue will get split between Obvio and the governments will vary from place to place, as Maheshwari said regulations about such agreements differ by state.\n\nThat clearly creates an incentive for increasing the number of citations. But Rehan and Maheshwari said they can build a business around stopping the worst offenses across a wide swath of American cities. They also said they want Obvio to remain present in — and responsive to — the communities that use their tech.\n\n“Automated enforcement should be used in conjunction with community advocacy and community support, it shouldn’t be this camera that you put up that does revenue grab[s] and gotchas,” Maheshwari said. The goal is to “start using these cameras in a way to warn and deter the most egregious drivers [so] you can actually create communitywide support and behavior change.”\n\nCities and their citizens “need to trust us,” Maheshwari said.\n\nThere’s also a technological explanation for why Obvio’s cameras may not become an overpowered surveillance tool for law enforcement beyond their intended use.\n\nObvio’s camera pylon records and processes its footage locally. It’s only when a violation is spotted that the footage leaves the device. Otherwise, all other footage of vehicles and pedestrians passing through a given intersection stays on the device for about 12 hours before it gets deleted. (The footage is also technically owned by the municipalities, which have remote access.)\n\nThis doesn’t eliminate the chance that law enforcement will use the footage to surveil citizens in other ways. But it does reduce that chance.\n\nThat focus is what drove Bain Capital Ventures partner Ajay Agarwal to invest in Obvio.\n\n“Yes, in the short term, you can maximize profits, and erode those values, but I think over time, it will limit the ability of this company to be ubiquitous. It’ll create enemies or create people who don’t want this,” he told TechCrunch. “Great founders are willing to sacrifice entire lines of business, frankly, and lots of revenue, in pursuit of the ultimate mission.”\n\nSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "full_text": "Microsoft’s new sustainability report, released late last week, shows how a carbon-heavy economy can weigh on a company that wants to be carbon light.\n\nSince 2020, the company’s carbon emissions are up 23.4%, mostly a result of breakneck data center buildout to support its growing cloud and AI operations. Buying enough clean electricity is actually the easy part — it’s the facilities themselves that are laden with carbon-intensive materials and products, including steel, concrete, and computer chips.\n\n“We reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips,” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “These are the biggest drivers of our Scope 3 challenges.”\n\nScope 3 emissions are those that are outside a company’s direct control, including raw materials, transportation, and purchased goods and services. Emissions in Scope 3 represent nearly all of Microsoft’s carbon footprint, just over 97% for fiscal year 2024, which the 2025 sustainability report covers.\n\nMicrosoft’s Scope 3 profile is dominated by capital goods and purchased goods and services, with the two contributing about three-quarters of the company’s total carbon emissions.\n\nThe construction of data centers has been the main driver behind Microsoft’s stubborn Scope 3 emissions. The steel used in the buildings comes from a supply chain that relies on blast furnaces heated by fossil fuels, and concrete used in the foundation is the product of a chemical reaction that’s both powered by and a producer of carbon dioxide. Some startups are working to decarbonize both steel and cement , and Microsoft is an investor in the space, but it’ll be years before those bets will have a significant impact.\n\nCarbon emissions are embodied in the computer chips inside the data center, too. Semiconductor lithography is dependent on chemicals that have extremely high global warming potential. For example, hexafluoroethane, which is used to etch features on chips, is a potent greenhouse gas, with 1 ton generating as much warming as 9,200 tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nEven in green electricity, which is easier to find, hurdles have popped up as data centers aren’t always built near abundant clean energy sources. Because of that, Microsoft has had a difficult time finding nearby sources of zero-carbon electricity, forcing it to rely on purchases elsewhere. “Our electricity consumption has grown faster than the grids where we operate have decarbonized,” the spokesperson said.\n\nOverall, Microsoft’s 2024 emissions were down slightly compared with 2023, suggesting that the company is getting better at building data centers with lower climate impacts. Still, it has a long way to go to meet its 2030 goal of removing more carbon pollution than it generates. By its own forecast, Microsoft will have to cut its emissions by more than half while also significantly ramping up its carbon-removal efforts.\n\nThere are signs that Microsoft is making some headway on both fronts. It has been one of the leading investors in and buyers of solar power in recent months, and its zero-carbon electricity portfolio now stands at 34 gigawatts of capacity. Plus, it has recently signed some very large deals that promise to remove millions of metric tons of carbon.\n\nHowever, 2030 is just a few years away, and the company’s push into AI and cloud may be profitable — but it’s made reaching its sustainability goals that much harder.\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor.\n\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "full_text": "Hyperscalers and data center developers are in a pickle: They all want to add computing power tomorrow , but utilities frequently play hard to get, citing years-long waits for grid connections.\n\n“All the AI data centers are struggling to get connected,” Amit Narayan, founder and CEO of Gridcare , told TechCrunch. “They’re so desperate. They are looking for solutions, which may or may not happen. Certainly not in the five-year timelines they cite.”\n\nThat has led many data centers to pursue what’s called “ behind the meter ” power sources — basically, they build their own power plants, a costly endeavor that hints at just how desperate they are for electricity.\n\nBut Narayan knew there was plenty of slack in the system, even if utilities themselves haven’t discovered it yet. He has studied the grid for the last 15 years, first as a Stanford researcher then as a founder of another company. “How do we create more capacity when everyone thinks that there is no capacity on the grid?” he said.\n\nNarayan said that Gridcare, which has been operating in stealth, has already discovered several places where extra capacity exists, and it’s ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities.\n\nGridcare recently closed an oversubscribed $13.5 million seed round, the company told TechCrunch. The round was led by Xora, Temasek’s deep tech venture firm, with participation from Acclimate Ventures, Aina Climate AI Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Discovery, Clearvision, Clocktower Ventures, Overture Ventures, Sherpalo Ventures, and WovenEarth.\n\nFor Narayan and his colleagues at Gridcare, the first step to finding untapped capacity was to map the existing grid. Then the company used generative AI to help forecast what changes might be implemented in the coming years. It also layers on other details, including the availability of fiber optic connections, natural gas, water, extreme weather, permitting, and community sentiment around data center construction and expansion.\n\n“There are 200,000-plus scenarios that you have to consider every time you’re running this study,” Narayan said.\n\nTo make sure it’s not running afoul of regulations, Gridcare then takes that data and weighs it against federal guidelines that dictate grid usage. Once it finds a spot, it starts talking with the relevant utility to verify the data.\n\n“We’ll find out where the maximum bang for the buck is,” Narayan said.\n\nAt the same time, Gridcare works with hyperscalers and data center developers to identify where they are looking to expand operations or build new ones. “They have already told us what they’re willing to do. We know the parameters under which they can operate,” he said.\n\nThat’s when the matchmaking begins.\n\nGridcare sells its services to data center developers, charging them a fee based on how many megawatts of capacity the startup can unlock for them. “That fee is significant for us, but it’s negligible for data centers,” Narayan said.\n\nFor some data centers, the price of admission might be forgoing grid power for a few hours here and there, relying on on-site backup power instead. For others, the path might be clearer if their demand helps green-light a new grid-scale battery installation nearby. In the future, the winner might be the developer that is willing to pay more. Utilities have already approached Gridcare inquiring about auctioning access to newfound capacity.\n\nRegardless of how it happens, Narayan thinks that Gridcare can unlock more than 100 gigawatts of capacity using its approach. “We don’t have to solve nuclear fusion to do this,” he said.\n\nUpdate: Corrected spare capacity on the grid to gigawatts from megawatts.\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The company already has more than 12 gigawatts of capacity in its renewable power portfolio.\n\nAES typically signs new power purchase agreements two to three years before they begin commercial operations, and the average term for such deals is 15 to 20 years, spokesperson Katie Lau said.\n\nThis is the fourth solar deal that Meta has announced this year. All are in Texas, with one clocking in at 595 megawatts , another at 505 megawatts , and the final two hitting 200 megawatts each.\n\nTexas has become a hotbed of solar development recently, leading the nation in new solar capacity installed in 2023 and 2024, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association . The state has ample sunshine, quick permitting, and speedy grid connections.\n\nThe latter two are particularly helpful when deploying a new solar capacity. With permitting and grid connections in place, a solar farm can be built in months rather than years. It doesn’t hurt that new solar is one of the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, even before subsidies are considered.\n\nPlus, data centers needn’t wait for construction to finish since solar farms can be phased in, with electricity flowing before project completion.

    "full_text": "The rush to capitalize on the buzz around AI has led tech companies to dramatically expand their data center footprints. That’s been good news for companies like Nvidia, but it has also led to unprecedented growth in the power industry.\n\nNew and expanded data centers are expected to double the sector’s power demand by 2029, according to JLL. As a result, developers and tech companies have been working overtime to lock in capacity. Nuclear and natural gas have gotten boosts from the forecasted demand, but few technologies have benefited in the near term like solar.\n\nThough solar power suffers from what experts call intermittency — it won’t produce if the sun isn’t shining — the upsides have been so significant that companies have been inking large deals at a rapid pace.\n\nUnlike advanced nuclear reactors, which have yet to be deployed at commercial scale, solar power is proven technology. And unlike new natural gas power plants, which take years to plan and construct, the average completion time for a new solar farm is about 18 months . Plus, it’s one of the lowest-cost sources of new generating capacity.\n\nSince the start of 2025, tech companies and data center operators have backed 12 solar deals, each adding more than 100 megawatts of capacity to the grid.\n\nMeta kicked off the year with a 200-megawatt solar deal with multinational electric utility Engie. The purchase went toward a solar farm near one of the company’s existing data centers in Texas. At the time of the deal, Meta already had over 12 gigawatts of generating capacity in its renewable portfolio.\n\nLater in January, the Stargate AI partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group was reported by Bloomberg to be powered, at least in part, by solar . SB Energy, which is part of SoftBank’s portfolio, is expected to develop solar installations backed by grid-scale batteries.\n\nMeta closed out the month with another massive solar deal , this one with Spanish renewable developer Zelestra. The contract was for 595 megawatts of capacity.\n\nMeta continued its streak in February, investing in a 505-megawatt solar project with Cypress Creek Renewables, which is developing the massive installation in Coleman County, Texas — about 150 miles northwest of Austin.\n\nMicrosoft entered the fray in February, too. The company has long been a buyer of renewable energy to power its operations, and added another 389 megawatts of solar in a deal with EDP Renewables North America. The contract covers three different solar farms, two in Illinois and one in Texas. The purchases have helped Microsoft stay on top of its pledge to power its operations using zero carbon power.\n\nAmazon also made a big purchase , backing a hybrid project on the Iberian Peninsula that includes wind, solar, and pumped-hydroelectric storage. The deal included 476 megawatts total, of which 212 megawatts are solar.\n\nOutside of the U.S., data center operators have also been investing in solar. In India, CtrlS built its own 125-megawatt facility in two phases, the first half of which was finished in June 2024 with the second completed in early February. In South America, Telecom Argentina agreed to buy electricity from a 130-megawatt solar farm developed by MSU Green Energy.\n\nMicrosoft added another three solar developments in March, again focusing on the Midwest . The projects span Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri, and they’re being developed by AES. Together, they will provide Microsoft with 475 megawatts of capacity, adding to its considerable 34-gigawatt portfolio.\n\nCisco got in the game with a 100-megawatt deal with X-Elio, a solar developer owned by Brookfield, an asset manager that has bet big on renewables. The power purchase agreements see Cisco buying capacity from two different Texas solar projects.\n\nMeta added another 200 megawatts of solar to its portfolio in March in a deal with RWE . The solar farm will be built just southeast of Austin.\n\nIn Italy, data center operator Data4 signed a 10-year deal with utility Edison Energia to buy power from a 148-megawatt solar farm northwest of Rome.\n\nAs tech companies race to add AI to seemingly every product and possible market, data centers have been expanding to keep pace. That growth requires power, and few technologies are as well positioned as solar power.\n\nUtility-scale solar is already one of the cheapest forms of new generating capacity without counting subsidies, undercutting everything except onshore wind. It’s also quick to deploy and can be commissioned in phases, allowing data centers to draw power before the entire project is finished.\n\nThose qualities have combined to give solar a near-term advantage, racking up deals with Big Tech companies and data center developers. It’s a trend that’s likely to continue.\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "full_text": "Nvidia announced Thursday it’s partnering with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to use AI to solve problems facing the electrical grid. Perhaps ironically, the issues are largely caused by rising power demand from AI itself .\n\nThe Open Power AI Consortium, which includes a number of electrical utilities and tech companies, says it will use what are known as domain-specific AI models to devise new ways to tackle problems that the power industry is predicted to face in the coming years. The models will be open sourced and available to researchers across academia and industry.\n\nThe power industry is facing surging demand from data centers in the United States and elsewhere as AI ramps up the need for computing power. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% annually in the coming years, according to the International Energy Agency, nearly double over 2023 figures.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia and EPRI, the consortium includes PG&E, Con Edison, Constellation Energy, Duke Energy, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and ENOWA, NEOM ’s energy and water company. On the tech side, Microsoft and Oracle are both members.\n\nIn an attempt to stay ahead of the trend, tech companies have been racing to secure generating capacity as power has transformed from a simple line item to a competitive advantage.\n\nOver the last year or so, tech companies have been consistently inking new contracts. They’ve largely been spread across renewable energy projects, spurred mostly by solar’s low cost, modularity, and the speed at which it can be deployed.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, recently added 475 megawatts of solar power to its sizable renewable portfolio.

    "full_text": "Microsoft is adding another 475 megawatts to its already considerable renewable-powered portfolio to feed the growing energy appetite of its data centers. The company recently signed a deal with energy provider AES for three solar projects across the Midwest, one each in Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri.\n\nThe ramp up reflects the immediacy of Microsoft’s needs. When it comes to powering data centers, it’s hard to argue with solar. Quick to install, inexpensive, and modular, it’s a perfect fit for tech companies that need electricity now.\n\nMicrosoft has been tapping solar with some regularity. In February, it contracted 389 megawatts from three solar projects across Illinois and Texas. And late last year, the company announced it was anchoring a $9 billion renewable power coalition that’s organized by Acadia. The Redmond-based company’s own renewable portfolio already includes over 34 GW of capacity.\n\nWhile tech companies have shown increasing interest in nuclear power in recent months, the cost and speed advantages of renewables have kept solar deals flowing.\n\nThough renewable power on its own doesn’t have the same consistency as nuclear or natural gas, developers are increasingly pairing it with battery storage to provide around-the-clock electricity.\n\nThe combination is more expensive than solar or wind on its own, but given the rapid declines in cost for both solar and batteries, so-called hybrid power plants are beginning to encroach on prices for a new natural gas generating capacity.\n\nSo far, new nuclear prices have remained significantly higher than either renewables or natural gas power plants.\n\nFor tech companies and data center developers, time is of the essence. Demand for new computing power has risen at such a rate that up to half of all new AI servers could be underpowered by 2027. Most new natural gas and nuclear power plants aren’t scheduled to come online until several years after that.\n\nBut renewables can start supplying power quickly, with utility-scale solar projects starting to produce electrons in about 18 months.\n\nThat speed has proven attractive, leading to some massive deals: Microsoft, for example, signed a deal with Brookfield Asset Management last summer for 10.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity in the U.S. and Europe, all of which will be delivered by 2030.\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "full_text": "In his annual letter , YouTube CEO Neal Mohan dubbed AI one of the company’s four “big bets” for 2025. The executive pointed to the company’s investments in AI tools for creators, including ones for video ideas, thumbnails, and language translation. The latter feature will roll out to all creators in YouTube’s Partner Program this month, the company said, while another AI feature will identify users’ ages to customize appropriate content and recommendations.\n\nOver the past year or so, YouTube has rolled out creator features for generating images and video backgrounds , as well as adding music to short videos .\n\nIntroducing AI into the video creation process has not been without controversy. Some argue that AI-created content will dilute the value of YouTube, as poorly made AI content floods the site. This isn’t a universally held point of view, however, as others suggest AI will be a tool to aid video production, not a replacement for creativity.\n\nOther AI tools help creators reach new audiences. This includes auto dubbing, which will let creators translate their videos into multiple language with minimal effort.\n\nIn his letter, Mohan says the auto dubbing feature will be available to all creators in the YouTube Partner Program later this month.\n\nThe company also said it will be investing in tools to detect and control how AI is used on YouTube. This will include an expansion of its pilot program with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) that will give more people access to tech that can identify and manage AI-generated content featuring their likeness.\n\nYouTube last fall announced a new set of AI detection tools that would protect creators, including artists, actors, musicians, and athletes, from having their likeness — such as their face and voice — copied and used in other videos. The expansion of YouTube’s existing Content ID system, which identifies copyright-protected material in videos, will detect simulated faces or voices that were made with AI tools, it said.\n\nMohan also noted in the letter that YouTube this year will deploy machine-learning technology to estimate users’ ages to assist with showing them age-appropriate experiences and recommendations. He did not reveal how the tech would determine ages or what might be done if the AI gets things wrong.\n\nHowever, social media services like Facebook , Instagram , TikTok , and others , have already been using age estimation and verification tech for years.\n\nOutside of AI, YouTube’s other big bets for 2025 included a focus on YouTube as the epicenter of culture (a position one could argue has been ceded to TikTok); YouTubers as the new Hollywood; and an emphasis on YouTube on TVs, which have now surpassed mobile as the primary viewing device for YouTube in the U.S.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

    "full_text": "A number of startups are racing to make vehicle inspections faster, easier, and cheaper. Self Inspection, a startup based in San Diego, thinks it has them all beat with its AI-powered service — and now it has convinced outside investors.\n\nSelf Inspection, founded in 2021 , is set to announce Thursday it’s raised $3 million in a seed round co-led by Costanoa Ventures and DVx Ventures, the firm run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill . Joining the round was Westlake Financial, which handles more than one million vehicle transactions annually.\n\nKarim Bousta, partner at DVx Ventures, believes the traditional vehicle inspection process is ripe for innovation. Self Inspection’s technology “not only streamlines operations for auto lenders, dealerships and rental companies, but also sets a new benchmark for quality, reliability and a seamless digital experience in the $30 billion vehicle inspection market,” Bousta said in a statement.\n\nThe seed round is validation of the tech the company has been working on for the last few years, CEO Constantine Yaremtso told TechCrunch. Self Inspection already counts Avis and CarOffer (a digital wholesaler owned by CarGurus) as customers, along with Westlake Financial.\n\n“Basically we’re going to start expanding, growing, and scaling,” Yaremtso said about the funding.\n\nSelf Inspection has taken a much different path from UVEye, which recently raised $191 million for its AI-powered drive-through inspection technology .\n\nSelf Inspection only needs a smartphone camera, although its software can also leverage data pulled from a car’s OBD2 port.\n\nThe company trained its AI models on what it describes as “one of the largest datasets of damaged vehicles.” Those models can quickly detect damage and assess the severity, before generating a cost estimate and “one of the most thorough vehicle inspection reports available in the industry.”\n\n“What we deliver is actually a fully detailed PDF report that you would normally only get from a body shop, which will tell you what labor needs to be done on the damage, how much it costs to repair, how many parts do you need, and so on,” Yaremtso said.\n\nSelf Inspection’s service is designed to be simple but configurable, which also sets it apart from competitors like Ravin , Yaremtso said.\n\nIn other words, Self Inspection’s software is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nWhat that means for customers is access to a slick back-end configurator. For instance, if a fleet or vehicle marketplace wants to prioritize certain high-wear areas of a car, or add a step to make sure an EV’s charging cable is in the trunk, they can just drag and drop those in Self Inspection’s software.\n\nSelf Inspection is also designed to be easier to use.\n\nThe software doesn’t require users to be a specific distance away from a car as they take photos or videos, like other services do. And for now, it’s not even a standalone app. Self Inspection integrates the software into its customers’ own workflows, and all vehicle inspections are done through a smartphone’s web browser — accessed after a user gets texted or emailed a link.\n\n“Everyone has a good camera, everyone has a good phone, everyone knows how to capture photos. As soon as they receive text message or email, it’s easy to go,” Yaremtso said. “We’re trying to give this tool to marketplaces, or banks, so anyone can inspect super simply and expedite the sales cycle process.”\n\nSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\n\nStrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders, and opportunities to forge meaningful connections.\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue Anthony Ha\n\nSam Altman says ‘enough’ to questions about OpenAI’s revenue\n\nMeta has an AI product problem Russell Brandom\n\nMeta has an AI product problem\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla Anthony Ha\n\nElon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams Julie Bort\n\nAI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta Sarah Perez\n\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff Aisha Malik\n\nYouTube announces ‘voluntary exit program’ for US staff\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant Ivan Mehta\n\nGrammarly rebrands to ‘Superhuman,’ launches a new AI assistant"

    "full_text": "Tech companies may be vocal about their love of advanced nuclear power — the flashy trend that’s been sweeping the energy sector — but they continue to add renewable capacity.\n\nMeta recently signed a deal with Spanish renewable developer Zelestra for 595 megawatts of solar power in Texas, just two weeks after signing a separate solar deal with utility company Engie . It’s a significant purchase for the tech company, representing a nearly 5% bump to the 12-plus gigawatts of renewable capacity it currently has under contract.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg maintains the company’s ambitious AI strategy — which will require hefty capital investments in data centers.\n\nMeta is racing to make its open source Llama 4 model a rival to closed-source competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. And while DeepSeek showed that models could be developed more efficiently, its approach doesn’t necessarily apply to leading-edge models like Llama 4.\n\nMeta plans to spend $60 billion this year on capital investments, most of which would go toward data center infrastructure, calling it a “strategic advantage” for the company, Zuckerberg said during a Wednesday earnings call.\n\nLike many of its peers, Meta is betting that nuclear reactors can provide stable power for its future compute needs, soliciting proposals for 1 to 4 gigawatts of capacity to come online in the early 2030s. One gigawatt is enough to power about 750,000 homes.\n\nBut the company can’t wait until then to add to its data center footprint. Meta and others are deploying enormous sums of capital to build data centers, which need correspondingly large amounts of power. The chokepoint has some experts predicting that half of all new AI data centers will be underpowered by 2027.\n\nNuclear power plants take years to build, and the latest crop of advanced reactors have yet to be commercially proven. Natural gas power plants are slightly faster.\n\nNeither can compete with the speed of renewable deployment.\n\nA solar farm can be brought online in as few as 18 months, and because the technology is modular, portions of the power plant can start delivering power before the last panel is connected.\n\nThat speed has allowed renewables like wind, solar, and grid-scale battery storage to continue racking up new contracts from tech companies. In addition to this week’s deal, Meta announced earlier this month it bought 200 megawatts of solar from Engie, which will come online later this year. Elsewhere, Microsoft is helping to deploy $9 billion worth of renewables with Acadia Infrastructure Capital, while Google is anchoring a $20 billion renewable fund with Intersect Power and TPG Rise.\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
