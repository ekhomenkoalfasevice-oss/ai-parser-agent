    "full_text": "Last week, an American-Israeli company that claims it’s developed proprietary technology to cool the planet announced it had raised $60 million, by far the largest known venture capital round to date for a solar geoengineering startup.\n\nThe company, Stardust, says the funding will enable it to develop a system that could be deployed by the start of the next decade, according to Heatmap , which broke the story.\n\nMIT Technology Review’s guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. You can read the rest of the pieces here .\n\nAs scientists who have worked on the science of solar geoengineering for decades, we have grown increasingly concerned about the emerging efforts to start and fund private companies to build and deploy technologies that could alter the climate of the planet. We also strongly dispute some of the technical claims that certain companies have made about their offerings.\n\nGiven the potential power of such tools, the public concerns about them, and the importance of using them responsibly, we argue that they should be studied, evaluated, and developed mainly through publicly coordinated and transparently funded science and engineering efforts.  In addition, any decisions about whether or how they should be used should be made through multilateral government discussions, informed by the best available research on the promise and risks of such interventions—not the profit motives of companies or their investors.\n\nThe basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases.\n\nThere is strong evidence, based on years of climate modeling and analyses by researchers worldwide, that SRM—while not perfect—could significantly and rapidly reduce climate changes and avoid important climate risks. In particular, it could ease the impacts in hot countries that are struggling to adapt.\n\nThe goals of doing research into SRM can be diverse: identifying risks as well as finding better methods. But research won’t be useful unless it’s trusted, and trust depends on transparency. That means researchers must be eager to examine pros and cons, committed to following the evidence where it leads, and driven by a sense that research should serve public interests, not be locked up as intellectual property.\n\nIn recent years, a handful of for-profit startup companies have emerged that are striving to develop SRM technologies or already trying to market SRM services. That includes Make Sunsets , which sells “ cooling credits ” for releasing sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere. A new company, Sunscreen , which hasn’t yet been announced, intends to use aerosols in the lower atmosphere to achieve cooling over small areas, purportedly to help farmers or cities deal with extreme heat.\n\nOur strong impression is that people in these companies are driven by the same concerns about climate change that move us in our research. We agree that more research, and more innovation, is needed. However, we do not think startups—which by definition must eventually make money to stay in business—can play a productive role in advancing research on SRM.\n\nMany people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere—at whichever scale—to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change.\n\nAdding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding.\n\nThe only way these startups will make money is if someone pays for their services, so there’s a reasonable fear that financial pressures could drive companies to lobby governments or other parties to use such tools. A decision that should be based on objective analysis of risks and benefits would instead be strongly influenced by financial interests and political connections.\n\nThe need to raise money or bring in revenue often drives companies to hype the potential or safety of their tools. Indeed, that’s what private companies need to do to attract investors, but it’s not how you build public trust—particularly when the science doesn’t support the claims.\n\nNotably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they’re “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” According to the company, “The particles naturally return to Earth’s surface over time and recycle safely back into the biosphere.”\n\nBut it’s nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. First of all, much of that chemistry depends on highly reactive radicals that react with any solid surface, and second, any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer by spreading that existing sulfuric acid over a larger surface area.\n\n(Stardust didn't provide a response to an inquiry about the concerns raised in this piece.)\n\nIn materials presented to potential investors, which we’ve obtained a copy of, Stardust further claims its particles “improve” on sulfuric acid, which is the most studied material for SRM. But the point of using sulfate for such studies was never that it was perfect, but that its broader climatic and environmental impacts are well understood. That’s because sulfate is widespread on Earth, and there’s an immense body of scientific knowledge about the fate and risks of sulfur that reaches the stratosphere through volcanic eruptions or other means.\n\nIf there’s one great lesson of 20th-century environmental science, it’s how crucial it is to understand the ultimate fate of any new material introduced into the environment.\n\nChlorofluorocarbons and the pesticide DDT both offered safety advantages over competing technologies, but they both broke down into products that accumulated in the environment in unexpected places, causing enormous and unanticipated harms.\n\nThe environmental and climate impacts of sulfate aerosols have been studied in many thousands of scientific papers over a century, and this deep well of knowledge greatly reduces the chance of unknown unknowns.\n\nGrandiose claims notwithstanding—and especially considering that Stardust hasn’t disclosed anything about its particles or research process—it would be very difficult to make a pragmatic, risk-informed decision to start SRM efforts with these particles instead of sulfate.\n\nWe don’t want to claim that every single answer lies in academia. We’d be fools to not be excited by profit-driven innovation in solar power, EVs, batteries, or other sustainable technologies. But the math for sunlight reflection is just different. Why?\n\nBecause the role of private industry was essential in improving the efficiency, driving down the costs, and increasing the market share of renewables and other forms of cleantech. When cost matters and we can easily evaluate the benefits of the product, then competitive, for-profit capitalism can work wonders.\n\nBut SRM is already technically feasible and inexpensive, with deployment costs that are negligible compared with the climate damage it averts.\n\nThe essential questions of whether or how to use it come down to far thornier societal issues: How can we best balance the risks and benefits? How can we ensure that it’s used in an equitable way? How do we make legitimate decisions about SRM on a planet with such sharp political divisions?\n\nTrust will be the most important single ingredient in making these decisions. And trust is the one product for-profit innovation does not naturally manufacture.\n\nUltimately, we’re just two researchers. We can’t make investors in these startups do anything differently. Our request is that they think carefully, and beyond the logic of short-term profit. If they believe geoengineering is worth exploring, could it be that their support will make it harder, not easier, to do that?\n\nDavid Keith is the professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago and founding faculty director of the school’s Climate Systems Engineering Initiative. Daniele Visioni is an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell University and head of data for Reflective, a nonprofit that develops tools and provides funding to support solar geoengineering research.\n\nPopular It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot Rhiannon Williams How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiral Jacob Judah Meet the man building a starter kit for civilization Tiffany Ng Bill Gates: Our best weapon against climate change is ingenuity Bill Gates\n\nIt’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot Rhiannon Williams\n\nHow AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiral Jacob Judah\n\nMeet the man building a starter kit for civilization Tiffany Ng\n\nBill Gates: Our best weapon against climate change is ingenuity Bill Gates\n\nA measure I call the Green Premium reveals where we can invest in climate progress for maximum impact.\n\nThe industry is getting billions, but it’s way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.\n\nLilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry.\n\nAlexander C.

Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. Then, just days later on February 24, experts declared that the danger had passed. Earth would be spared. How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?

    "full_text": "The State of AI is a collaboration between the Financial Times & MIT Technology Review examining the ways in which AI is reshaping global power. Every Monday for the next six weeks, writers from both publications will debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution reshaping global power.\n\nIn this conversation, the FT’s tech columnist and Innovation Editor John Thornhill and MIT Technology Review’s Caiwei Chen consider the battle between Silicon Valley and Beijing for technological supremacy.\n\nViewed from abroad, it seems only a matter of time before China emerges as the AI superpower of the 21st century.\n\nHere in the West, our initial instinct is to focus on America’s significant lead in semiconductor expertise, its cutting-edge AI research, and its vast investments in data centers. The legendary investor Warren Buffett once warned: “Never bet against America.” He is right that for more than two centuries, no other “incubator for unleashing human potential” has matched the US.\n\nToday, however, China has the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the equivalent of technological murder. When it comes to mobilizing the whole-of-society resources needed to develop and deploy AI to maximum effect, it may be just as rash to bet against.\n\nThe data highlights the trends. In AI publications and patents, China leads. By 2023, China accounted for 22.6% of all citations, compared with 20.9% from Europe and 13% from the US, according to Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 . As of 2023, China also accounted for 69.7% of all AI patents. True, the US maintains a strong lead in the top 100 most cited publications (50 versus 34 in 2023), but its share has been steadily declining.\n\nSimilarly, the US outdoes China in top AI research talent, but the gap is narrowing. According to a report from the US Council of Economic Advisers , 59% of the world’s top AI researchers worked in the US in 2019, compared with 11% in China. But by 2022 those figures were 42% and 28%.\n\nThe Trump administration’s tightening of restrictions for foreign H-1B visa holders may well lead more Chinese AI researchers in the US to return home. The talent ratio could move further in China’s favor.\n\nRegarding the technology itself, US-based institutions produced 40 of the world’s most notable AI models in 2024, compared with 15 from China. But Chinese researchers have learned to do more with less, and their strongest large language models—including the open-source DeepSeek-V3 and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5-Max—surpass the best US models in terms of algorithmic efficiency.\n\nWhere China is really likely to excel in future is in applying these open-source models. The latest report from Air Street Capital shows that China has now overtaken the US in terms of monthly downloads of AI models. In AI-enabled fintech, e-commerce, and logistics, China already outstrips the US.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing—and potentially the most productive—applications of AI may yet come in hardware, particularly in drones and industrial robotics. With the research field evolving toward embodied AI, China’s advantage in advanced manufacturing will shine through.\n\nDan Wang, the tech analyst and author of Breakneck , has rightly highlighted the strengths of China’s engineering state in developing manufacturing process knowledge—even if he has also shown the damaging effects of applying that engineering mentality in the social sphere. “China has been growing technologically stronger and economically more dynamic in all sorts of ways,” he told me. “But repression is very real. And it is getting worse in all sorts of ways as well.”\n\nI’d be fascinated to hear from you, Caiwei, about your take on the strengths and weaknesses of China’s AI dream. To what extent will China’s engineered social control hamper its technological ambitions?\n\nYou’re right that the US still holds a clear lead in frontier research and infrastructure. But “winning” AI can mean many different things. Jeffrey Ding, in his book Technology and the Rise of Great Powers , makes a counterintuitive point: For a general-purpose technology like AI, long-term advantage often comes down to how widely and deeply technologies spread across society. And China is in a good position to win that race (although “murder” might be pushing it a bit!).\n\nChips will remain China’s biggest bottleneck. Export restrictions have throttled access to top GPUs, pushing buyers into gray markets and forcing labs to recycle or repair banned Nvidia stock. Even as domestic chip programs expand, the performance gap at the very top still stands.\n\nYet those same constraints have pushed Chinese companies toward a different playbook : pooling compute, optimizing efficiency, and releasing open-weight models. DeepSeek-V3’s training run, for example, used just 2.6 million GPU-hours—far below the scale of US counterparts. But Alibaba’s Qwen models now rank among the most downloaded open-weights globally, and companies like Zhipu and MiniMax are building competitive multimodal and video models.\n\nChina’s industrial policy means new models can move from lab to implementation fast. Local governments and major enterprises are already rolling out reasoning models in administration, logistics, and finance.\n\nEducation is another advantage. Major Chinese universities are implementing AI literacy programs in their curricula, embedding skills before the labor market demands them. The Ministry of Education has also announced plans to integrate AI training for children of all school ages. I’m not sure the phrase “engineering state” fully captures China’s relationship with new technologies, but decades of infrastructure building and top-down coordination have made the system unusually effective at pushing large-scale adoption, often with far less social resistance than you’d see elsewhere. The use at scale, naturally, allows for faster iterative improvements.\n\nMeanwhile, Stanford HAI’s 2025 AI Index found Chinese respondents to be the most optimistic in the world about AI’s future—far more optimistic than populations in the US or the UK. It’s striking, given that China’s economy has slowed since the pandemic for the first time in over two decades. Many in government and industry now see AI as a much-needed spark. Optimism can be powerful fuel, but whether it can persist through slower growth is still an open question.\n\nSocial control remains part of the picture, but a different kind of ambition is taking shape. The Chinese AI founders in this new generation are the most globally minded I’ve seen, moving fluidly between Silicon Valley hackathons and pitch meetings in Dubai. Many are fluent in English and in the rhythms of global venture capital. Having watched the last generation wrestle with the burden of a Chinese label, they now build companies that are quietly transnational from the start.\n\nThe US may still lead in speed and experimentation, but China could shape how AI becomes part of daily life, both at home and abroad. Speed matters, but speed isn’t the same thing as supremacy.\n\nYou’re right, Caiwei, that speed is not the same as supremacy (and “murder” may be too strong a word). And you’re also right to amplify the point about China’s strength in open-weight models and the US preference for proprietary models. This is not just a struggle between two different countries’ economic models but also between two different ways of deploying technology.\n\nEven OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, admitted earlier this year : “We have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy.” That’s going to be a very interesting subplot to follow. Who’s called that one right?\n\nFurther reading on the US-China competition\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk about how people may be using generative AI in their daily lives.

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\n7 MCP Projects That You Must Do Before 2025 Ends!\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly developing as a foundation for contextualizing and exchanging information among models. The future of AI is headed towards distributed multi-agent interaction and inference, and these initiatives of using MCP, are the first to create resource-efficient, sharing, and contextually relevant AI applications. In this article, we will explore MCP projects that all AI engineers should learn from or try experimenting with.\n\nMCP Client Server using LangChain\n\nHere are the MCP projects that you could experiment with to hone your skills:\n\nThe Multi-Agent Deep Researcher project represents an amazing MCP-compliant research assistant that combines CrewAI for orchestration, LinkUp for deep web searching, and the phi3 model (which runs through Ollama ) to synthesize and reason across information. The workflow is really cool, comprised of three themed agents: a Web Searcher, Research Analyst, and Technical Writer which work in sequence to provide you with a rich, organized answer to your query.\n\nMCP-compliant server with seamless integrations to other tools\n\nFully modular, agentic flow for easy customization\n\nLocal inference and synthetic writing using phi3\n\nSupports json-based api calls via /research\n\nIf you’re an AI Engineer interesting in getting to know or working with multi-agent orchestration, MCP integration and developing autonomous research systems, then this might be the project for you to start with.\n\nThis project brings together LangChain’s orchestration capabilities with MCP’s flexible message passing to build a minimal MCP client-server setup. If you’re trying to understand how modular communication protocols and LLMs can cooperate, this is an excellent learning project.\n\nIt provides us with step-by-step workflow of how we can setup MCP within the workflows of LangChain .\n\nIt basically shows us how the client-server interacts with each other also.\n\nIt provides us with a great starting point to experiment with the MCP Endpoints\n\nProject Link: MCP Client Server using MC P\n\nThis project basically combines the advantages of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with model agent framework using MCP. The agents work independently on focused functions such as retrieving and verifying information and generating data into useful context. This strategic division of work results in enhanced responses, clarity in output, logic and minimalizes the risk of errors or hallucinations .\n\nUsing agent-level reasoning, it integrates RAG pipelines in an efficient way that produces responses that are much more reliable and contextual.\n\nIt can be used for business or research purposes\n\nAn amazing example of MCP orchestration that runs itself\n\nThis project is designed for customisation, the chatbot is exclusively powered by MCP and allows you flexible integration via external APIs. It supports fine-grained memory, tool usage, and customization by domain.\n\nIt has a modular architecture for a chatbot which is pretty easy to adapt\n\nBy making use of MCP, it allows us to connect to knowledge bases\n\nIt provides rich conversational memory for continuity of context\n\nThe project effectively illustrates how financial-type analytical activity can use MCP to facilitate LLM communicating with tools for real time financial data. It allows the financial data analyst to get context sensitive knowledge, risk summaries, and even generate accurate reports on demand.\n\nIt provides real-time data pipeline with MCP integration\n\nAutonomous data querying and summarization\n\nIt is especially great if you’re a FinTech AI engineer\n\nProject Link: Building a MCP Powered Financial Analys t\n\nWith the Voice MCP Agent, you can communicate with agents using voice commands through the MCP. Here the Voice commands are transformed from natural language into interactive context for AI models and tools. The main purpose of this agent is to provide an example of a speech-to-intent pipeline thanks to local MCP nodes.\n\nLocal speech recognition and intent routing\n\nExcellent for smart assistant and robotics integration\n\nThis innovative project enabled by MCP brings memory persistence into Cursor AI giving you a longer-term ability for contextual awareness when working with LLM-based coding copilots. It makes use of the MCP memory structure to keep memory in sync locally instead across sessions and tools.\n\nIt allows recall and persistent memory for MCP agents\n\nAt the IDE Level, it provides contextual intelligence\n\nHere is a summary of the MCP projects listed in this article, along with their purpose and notable components:\n\nThe MCP ecosystem is truly transforming the ways that AI systems can collaborate, orchestrate, and reason. From multi-agent collaboration to the production of on-device, local data, these projects illustrate how powerful MCP can become, and that you as an AI engineer can create modular, context-aware systems that can interoperate with different domains.\n\nA. MCP gives models a common language to talk to tools, data sources, and other agents. It’s the backbone for scalable multi-agent systems, letting you build modular workflows where models coordinate instead of acting in isolation.\n\nA. Not at all. Many MCP projects run locally with lightweight models or simple servers. You can start with small prototypes (like LangChain integration)and scale once you understand the workflow.\n\nA. APIs connect systems, but MCP standardizes context sharing and tool interaction. Instead of one-off integrations, you get a protocol that lets different models and tools plug in and collaborate, making your pipelines more reusable and future-proof.\n\nData Science Trainee at Analytics Vidhya I am currently working as a Data Science Trainee at Analytics Vidhya, where I focus on building data-driven solutions and applying AI/ML techniques to solve real-world business problems.

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\nTop 10 AI Tools for Writers: With My Favourite 3\n\nA host of AI tools out there have changed the way people work. Being an author, I can confirm that writers are no different. While writing with AI is still a controversial subject for most, the fact remains that AI can be a massive help to writers. How? Well, if you’ve ever written a piece worth reading, you know the struggle of writer’s block is real. Whether it be an absence of ideas, doubts on your writing’s structure, or simply the lack of information, AI can quickly become your go-to aid for all such writing struggles.\n\nWith that in mind, I thought I’d share how I use AI to enhance my own writing. In addition, I shall also list some of the best AI tools I have personally come across so far. So if you often find yourself on one end of a pen or a keyboard, read on.\n\nAI for Writing: How does it help Complete writings Brainstorming Writing style Editing and Revision Research and Fact-Checking\n\nTop AI Tools for Writers ChatGPT Gemini Claude Grok Grammarly AI Sudowrite Rytr Wordtune Squibler Quillbot AI\n\nAuthor’s Pick – The Top 3\n\nAs I mentioned above, AI can be your go-to assistant for writing. To think of it, the whole purpose of the AI wave we see today is to minimise the menial tasks we often face. Crunching numbers , drafting ideas, or simply brainstorming, AI tends to bring a whole new perspective across use cases. In a similar fashion, AI is a huge aid for writers when used correctly. Here are some of the ways AI can help you with writing:\n\nThough often frowned upon, there are times when you may need a publishing-ready copy in minutes. In such cases, simply draft the perfect prompt and let AI do the heavy lifting. Most of the tools mentioned below are capable of producing extensive write-ups on any possible topic you can imagine. Of course, you will lack that human touch, and chances are, any avid reader will know it is AI-produced.\n\nI often use AI for this. Drafting the right ideas before you begin writing your piece can streamline the entire writing process and drastically enhance productivity. In case you lack clarity on the topic or how to structure it, AI tools can often help you frame a rough outline of the write-up even before the first word is written.\n\nThis one is especially for all the marketers out there. Oftentimes, tasks at hand require you to frame a certain narrative or take on a certain persona. If you are not already well aware of it, you can easily find use of these AI tools to produce content in a certain manner. Just make sure you prompt it right , and I am sure you will be amazed by the results.\n\nOther than writing from scratch, AI also helps you refine what is already written. AI tools like Manus or ChatGPT can analyse tone, structure, clarity, and suggest real-time improvements that make your writing tighter and more readable. Whether it’s trimming redundancies or enhancing vocabulary, AI can instantly elevate a rough draft into a polished piece.\n\nWriters often spend hours gathering references or verifying facts (I know I do). AI can drastically shorten that process. With access to massive knowledge bases, it can summarise topics, pull verified data, and cross-check claims. While human verification is still essential, AI can be your first-pass researcher, saving hours on background work.\n\nI am certain, as a writer, you will find all of these capabilities helpful at some point or the other. Now that you know what to expect, here are the top AI tools you can use to get the best out of AI for a splendid write-up.\n\nHere is a list of the top 10 AI tools I have used for writing. As an experiment to show you the capabilities of each of these, I have also used a prompt on each of the AI tools and shared their outputs here. You will find that the prompt tests creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, some technical know-how, and a human touch for the perfect response.\n\nHere is the prompt I used:\n\nWrite a short 150–200-word piece titled “The Last Human Editor.”\n\nImagine a near-future where AI writes almost everything, like news, novels, and even scripts. But one human editor still exists in a quiet office, reviewing AI-generated words before they go out to the world.\n\nDescribe what this editor feels while reading text written by machines. Show emotions like awe, fatigue, nostalgia, or pride. Add subtle technical references to how AI writing models work (like data training or language patterns) but keep the tone deeply human and reflective.\n\nEnd the piece with a single striking line that captures the tension between creativity and code.\n\nNow, to begin with the list\n\nI’ve sworn by ChatGPT for any and every task in many of my articles to date. The reason is very simple – ChatGPT brings an unmatched familiarity that cannot easily be replicated. Rightly so, as it was one of the first AI chatbots out there that revolutionised the world we live in. Also, with time, I have been able to train it for the best possible outputs as per my requirement. Now, my ChatGPT knows just how and what to write whenever I ask it to. You can read about how I trained my ChatGPT here .\n\nAs for its capabilities, ChatGPT is still among the frontrunners when it comes to AI capabilities. This naturally extends to writing tasks, meaning it can help you draft an email or write a novel full of plot twists. Just learn how to use it properly, and it will be your best writing assistant in no time.\n\nPricing: Free + Subscription based\n\nAccess: App or website ( Click here )\n\nGemini is Google’s ambitious leap into the generative AI space. Whether you’re drafting articles, refining tone, or researching data-backed insights, Gemini blends Google Search’s reliability with the creative power of a language model ( check out how it yields mind-blowing images, here ). For writers, this means faster, more accurate outputs and the ability to work directly within Docs, Gmail, or Slides.\n\nI often find myself loving Gemini for factual grounding. It proves to be perfect for the times when both precision and creativity are critical. It’s particularly adept at context-aware writing. This means that it ensures your draft aligns with your topic and tone from start to finish.\n\nAccess: Via Google Workspace or Website ( Click here )\n\nClaude is one of the most refined AI writing companions available today. Designed by Anthropic, it stands out for its human-like tone, contextual understanding, and a mighty impressive ability to maintain long-form coherence. For authors, this means you can brainstorm storylines, generate dialogue, or refine entire chapters without losing consistency in voice or narrative flow.\n\nI use Claude majorly for its balanced approach. It is creative, yet factual; imaginative, yet grounded. Like me, writers who value nuance, empathy, and emotional resonance in their work often find Claude to be their ideal writing partner.\n\nPricing: Free + Pro plan\n\nGrok, developed by xAI, brings a refreshingly bold personality to the world of AI writing tools. True to its creator Elon Musk’s style, Grok is witty, opinionated, and unafraid to inject humour into serious topics. For authors, that means it’s perfect for crafting sharp, thought-provoking content that breaks the monotony of traditional prose. Whether you’re scripting a satirical piece, writing commentary, or just looking for creative sparks, Grok can add a touch of unapologetic authenticity to your writing.\n\nWhat I particularly like about Grok is its attitude. Instead of simply assisting you, it challenges you on every step. It’s less of a passive AI tool and more of a co-writer with a strong, distinctive voice that makes your work stand out.\n\nPricing: Free (for X Premium+ users)\n\nAccess: Available on X (Twitter) or Website\n\nGrammarly AI has evolved far beyond being just a grammar checker. It is now a full-fledged writing companion. Its new generative AI layer helps authors rephrase, summarise, and even ideate with remarkable precision. What’s more, it offers deep integration across writing platforms – from browsers to documents. This helps ensure that your writing stays consistent everywhere you type.\n\nI find Grammarly AI most useful for polishing drafts after the creative stage. It’s fast, accurate, and perfect for writers of all types. After all, no one would want a dim, uninspired write-up if you have the option of enhancing it right then and there, right?\n\nPricing: Free + Premium plans\n\nAccess: Available via grammarly.com website and browser extensions\n\nSudowrite is every fiction author’s secret weapon. It is built specifically for creative writing. How, you ask? It helps you brainstorm characters , build vivid scenes, and refine your storytelling voice. Wish to get your mind blown? Try using Sudowrite to suggest plot twists, sensory details, and dialogue that sound authentically human. Thank me later.\n\nToday, many novelists use Sudowrite to explore alternate story directions or reimagine tone and pacing. Think of it as your brainstorming partner that never tires, always ready to help you bring ideas to life.\n\nI’ve found Rytr to be one of the most approachable AI writing tools out there. It is fast, affordable, and incredibly easy to use. It’s perfect for writers who want quick drafts, blog outlines, or short stories without getting tangled in complex settings. You simply choose a tone, a format, and a few guiding words, and Rytr delivers coherent, ready-to-edit content within seconds.\n\nRytr simplicity is the USP here. It doesn’t overwhelm you with options. Instead, it focuses on getting your ideas out fast. For everyday writing tasks, from social captions to story snippets, Rytr is an effortless companion.\n\nPricing: Free + Paid plans\n\nWhile other AI tools here write for you, Wordtune is more about helping you write better. Acting like a real-time editor, it fine-tunes your phrasing, improves clarity, and adjusts tone to match your intent. I’ve especially found its suggestions to be more human than mechanical, whether for a novel, an article, or an email.\n\nIts biggest strength lies in rewriting. You can take any clunky line, feed it into Wordtune, and instantly see smoother, more natural alternatives. For writers obsessed with precision and flow, it’s like having an intelligent editor by your side.\n\nThis one is for book/ novel writers who wish to write extensive narratives. From screenwriters to novelists, it offers templates for plots, character arcs, and dialogue, making it ideal for both beginners and seasoned authors. The AI writing assistant helps you expand scenes, maintain tone, and ensure consistency throughout long manuscripts.\n\nIts standout feature is “Flow,” a timeline-style editor that lets you visualise your story chapter by chapter. Now combine it with real-time collaboration and cloud syncing. You will soon find Squibler less like a writing tool and more like a creative studio in your browser.\n\nPricing: Free trial + Paid plans\n\nKnown originally for its AI checker and paraphrasing capabilities, Quillbot AI now stands out for its speed and accuracy, making it one of the most efficient writing tools for authors and professionals alike. What’s more, Quillbot now offers an entire suite of AI-powered writing aids, including a grammar checker, summarizer, citation generator, and tone customizer. Whether you’re rephrasing complex ideas or refining sentence flow, Quillbot’s algorithms deliver crisp, human-like results in seconds.\n\nI personally love the intuitive interface and lightning-fast processing of Quillbot AI. It is ideal for those who want clean, publish-ready text without sacrificing nuance or intent.\n\nPricing: Free + Pro plans\n\nThough tough, I decide upon my top choices here based on a few major reasons – the AI tool I prefer for writing should be simple to use, quick to respond, versatile, and give out the best quality possible. I believe that’s what most other writers like me would wish for. My apologies in advance if I am missing any crucial factors here.\n\nAnyway, based on the criteria I’ve listed above, my top 3 picks from this list of AI tools for writers are –\n\nChatGPT: The most versatile tool that lets you brainstorm, fact check, grammar check, and even write entire lengths of text based on a single prompt. All of this, within a super simple chat window. What more can one ask for?\n\nClaude: The sheer quality of output that Claude comes out with puts it high on this list. While a generic AI tool for a range of tasks, Claude somehow feels more like a tool made specifically for writing fantastic pieces.\n\nGemini + Claude: The tie here is thanks to the splendid and sharp outcomes that both these AI tools are able to generate every time without fail. While they are just LLM models like most others, they somehow seem to have a unique tone and voice for every write-up they generate.\n\nWell, that was my bit to help all my writer friends out there elevate their writing experience to a whole new level.

Many of us have been wearing the company’s T-shirts for decades, and yet the question of whether there is a woven brown horn of plenty on the logo is surprisingly contentious. According to a 2022 poll, 55% of Americans believe the logo does include a cornucopia, 25% are unsure, and only 21% are confident that it doesn’t, even though this last group is correct. There’s a name for what’s happening here: the “Mandela effect,” or collective false memory, so called because a number of people misremember that Nelson Mandela died in prison. Yet while many find it easy to let their unconfirmable beliefs go, some spend years seeking answers—and vindication.

When they added just four proteins to a skin cell and waited about two weeks, some of the cells underwent an unexpected and astounding transformation: they became young again. They turned into stem cells almost identical to the kind found in a days-old embryo, just beginning life’s journey. At least in a petri dish, researchers using the procedure can take withered skin cells from a 101-year-old and rewind them so they act as if they’d never aged at all. Now, after more than a decade of studying and tweaking so-called cellular reprogramming, a number of biotech companies and research labs say they have tantalizing hints that the process could be the gateway to an unprecedented new technology for age reversal.

    "summary": "For instance, clinicians tend to verbalize their thought process more when there is alternative notetaking during a patient evaluation. “We originally thought that patients would be worried about an AI device listening, but actually they are very excited,” says Alexandre LeBrun, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nabla. “They get the full attention of their physician during the visit, and they love when they hear technical language as they sense they get better care.” According to LeBrun, Nabla’s system can further support clinicians by automating pre-charting, reviewing and organizing a patient’s information in their EHR before an appointment, and coding medical data for use in areas like billing. All before the patient even walks into the room,” LeBrun explains. “Rather than forcing doctors and nurses to click through a dozen separate systems, our platform will provide specialized, customizable, and composable AI agents that turn disconnected tools into a single, continuous workflow.” Lee says that agentic AI’s near-term scope includes standardized and protocolized non-clinical tasks, but he sees promise in areas like treatment options and other types of clinical decision support, where AI can safely operate with clinicians always “in the loop.” To get to this point, education is essential, says Lee. “The beauty of medicine is that it’s a lifelong learning process. Additionally, “a culture of inclusivity, authenticity, and transparency needs to be in place so you can be in the best position to be successful with transformative efforts such as incorporating and integrating agentic AI into the ecosystem,” he says. “Part of that journey is involving frontline users to be part of the process, co-designing whenever possible and conducting pilots of new solutions so the organization can learn.” Applying AI to high-stakes sectors like health care requires a careful balance between productivity on the one hand, and accuracy on the other. “Trust is everything in medicine,” says LeBrun. “Earning that trust means giving clinicians confidence through accuracy, transparency, and respect for their expertise.” Nabla uses techniques like adversarial training models to check outputs, and it defaults to conservative responses. “We optimize precision.",
    "full_text": "How ambient AI assistants are supporting clinicians to save time, reduce burnout, and enhance treatment, restoring the doctor-patient experience.\n\nFor many clinicians, administration is a whole job on its own. From examination findings to proposed treatments, test results, and patient education, clinicians must maintain accurate, clear, and timely clinical records every step of the way. And the burden is getting heavier. Complex billing requirements and ever-changing regulations demand extensive documentation. And systems for electronic health records (EHR) are often unintuitive and inefficient, with complicated workflows that slow the process.\n\nThis administrative load occupies at least eight hours of a US physician’s 59-hour work week, according to the American Medical Association (AMA), with many spending more than eight hours on electronic medical records outside working hours. This all contributes to burnout, which affects nearly half of US physicians .\n\nBut ambient AI assistants are already offering a means of simplifying workflows, expediting patient records, and improving the overall efficiency of the health care system, with agentic AI poised to take on more of the administrative burden in the future. This is transforming the way clinicians spend their time and increasing their opportunities to engage meaningfully with patients.\n\n“I didn’t go to medical school to be a scribe. There should be technology that can do this task for me,” says Dr. Ed Lee, practicing physician and chief medical officer at health care AI company Nabla, which launched its first ambient AI assistant in 2023, now used by hundreds of health care organizations in the US.\n\nSource: Compiled by MIT Technology Review Insights, based on data from AMA , 2025\n\nCurrent ambient AI assistants, which gained mainstream traction in 2023, are already able to record, structure, and summarize patient encounters in real time. This liberates clinicians from the time-consuming exercise of writing notes, allowing them to fully engage with their patients. “For complex patients, it could take me up to 45 minutes to complete the documentation. Nabla makes that task infinitely better and allows me to give each patient my full, undivided attention. At the end of the visit, I click, and Nabla produces a thoughtfully crafted, concise record of what happened,” says Lee, who puts the accuracy of Nabla’s system in the “high 90s” in terms of percentage, with the clinician always responsible for reviewing and signing off on the final record.\n\n“For complex patients, it could take me up to 45 minutes to complete the documentation. Nabla makes that task infinitely better and allows me to give each patient my full, undivided attention. At the end of the visit, I click, and Nabla produces a thoughtfully crafted, concise record of what happened.”\n\nThis kind of uninterrupted patient engagement can lead to better eye contact and a higher quality interaction. For instance, clinicians tend to verbalize their thought process more when there is alternative notetaking during a patient evaluation. “We originally thought that patients would be worried about an AI device listening, but actually they are very excited,” says Alexandre LeBrun, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nabla. “They get the full attention of their physician during the visit, and they love when they hear technical language as they sense they get better care.”\n\nAccording to LeBrun, Nabla’s system can further support clinicians by automating pre-charting, reviewing and organizing a patient’s information in their EHR before an appointment, and coding medical data for use in areas like billing. Nabla has also expanded its platform with a built-in dictation capability, bringing clinicians closer to a unified experience. These kinds of AI assistant tasks can help to streamline and enhance clinical workflows and contribute to a reduction in institutional administrative costs.\n\nAgentic AI, which companies like Nabla are currently working to integrate into their systems, promises to take the success of existing AI assistants a step further. LeBrun is looking to a future in which clinicians interact with an agentic platform that links to all the tools they already use and simplifies multi-step interactions, like reading patient data, acting within the EHR, and adapting to workflows in real time.\n\n“Rather than forcing doctors and nurses to click through a dozen separate systems, our platform will provide specialized, customizable, and composable agents that turn disconnected tools into a single, continuous workflow,” LeBrun says.\n\n“Imagine a cardiologist getting ready for their morning clinic. After a few voice commands to instruct the system, one agent pulls the latest vitals, lab results, and imaging reports from the EHR, another generates a clear patient summary, and a third flags a missed follow-up echocardiogram. All before the patient even walks into the room,” LeBrun explains.\n\n“Rather than forcing doctors and nurses to click through a dozen separate systems, our platform will provide specialized, customizable, and composable AI agents that turn disconnected tools into a single, continuous workflow.”\n\nLee says that agentic AI’s near-term scope includes standardized and protocolized non-clinical tasks, but he sees promise in areas like treatment options and other types of clinical decision support, where AI can safely operate with clinicians always “in the loop.”\n\nTo get to this point, education is essential, says Lee. “The beauty of medicine is that it’s a lifelong learning process. It’s not just learning about the science behind medications, diagnoses, and treatments; it’s about adapting to the use of new tools that will ultimately improve the care of the patients you treat,” he explains.\n\n“We need to start with the basics of AI, making sure everyone understands what it is and how it works. Not how the programming takes place but more around what it can do, what it can’t do, the risks and pitfalls, and then really understanding where it fits best in the care of patients,” says Lee.\n\nLeadership must look ahead strategically and ensure the entire organization is moving forward with its use and understanding of AI, he adds. “Part of that journey is involving frontline users to be part of the process, co-designing whenever possible and conducting pilots of new solutions so the organization can learn,” Lee says. Additionally, “a culture of inclusivity, authenticity, and transparency needs to be in place so you can be in the best position to be successful with transformative efforts such as incorporating and integrating agentic AI into the ecosystem,” he says.\n\n“Part of that journey is involving frontline users to be part of the process, co-designing whenever possible and conducting pilots of new solutions so the organization can learn.”\n\nApplying AI to high-stakes sectors like health care requires a careful balance between productivity on the one hand, and accuracy on the other. “Trust is everything in medicine,” says LeBrun. “Earning that trust means giving clinicians confidence through accuracy, transparency, and respect for their expertise.” Nabla uses techniques like adversarial training models to check outputs, and it defaults to conservative responses. “We optimize precision. If we have a slight doubt, we prefer to remove something from the output by default,” says LeBrun\n\n“Trust is everything in medicine. Earning that trust means giving clinicians confidence through accuracy, transparency, and respect for their expertise.”\n\nNew tools must also interweave with existing workflows and platforms to avoid adding more complexity for clinicians. “Any product can look great, but if it doesn’t fit well into your existing workflows, it’s almost useless,” says LeBrun.\n\nIn sectors like customer service, it is straightforward to build a new interface or platform, but that approach isn’t feasible—or desirable—in health care. “It's a complex network of dependencies with so many workflows and processes,” says LeBrun. “Everybody would like to get rid of these things, but it's not possible because you would need to change everything at once.” Agentic AI approaches offer great promise to sectors like health care because they can “improve the process without getting rid of the legacy infrastructure,“ LeBrun explains.\n\nBy simplifying complex systems, automating routine tasks, and continuing to take on more of the time-consuming burden of administrative work, agentic AI holds great promise in further augmenting ambient AI assistants. Ultimately, the technology’s potential is not in making medical decisions or replacing clinicians, but in supporting health care workers to dedicate more of their time and attention to their main priority: their patients. “AI should focus on supporting decisions and automating everything downstream,” says LeBrun. “The first role of AI is to get physicians back to the state where they make medical decisions.”\n\nDiscover more insights from Nabla here .\n\nThis content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\nNo Job Apocalypse Coming: 10 AGI Myths Busted by Andrej Karapathy\n\nEveryone loves a good hype train. And when it comes to AGI myths, the train has no brakes. Every few weeks, someone declares, “This is it!” They say agents will take over jobs, economies will explode, and education will magically fix itself. The guy sitting at the helm of this transition – Andrej Karpathy, has a different take.\n\nIn a recent interview with Dwarkesh Patel, he calmly takes a sledgehammer to the most popular AGI myths, important reality checks from someone who helped build modern AI itself. He explains why agents aren’t interns, why demos lie, and why code is the first battlefield. He even talks about why AI tutors feel… a bit like ChatGPT in a bad mood.\n\nSo, let’s explore how Karpathy sees the AI world of the future a bit differently than most of us. Here are 10 AGI Myths Karpathy busted and what they reveal about the actual road to AGI.\n\nMyth #1: “2024 is the Year of Agents.”\n\nMyth #2: “Agents can already replace interns.”\n\nMyth #3: “Reinforcement Learning is enough to get to AGI.”\n\nMyth #4: “We can build AGI like animals learn – one algorithm, raw data.”\n\nMyth #5: “The more knowledge you pack into weights, the smarter the model.”\n\nMyth #6: “Coding is just one of many domains AGI will conquer equally.”\n\nMyth #7: “Demos = products. Once it works in a demo, the problem is solved.”\n\nMyth #8: “AGI will cause an immediate economic spike.”\n\nMyth #9: “We’re overbuilding compute. Demand won’t be there.”\n\nMyth #10: “Bigger models are the only path to AGI.”\n\nConclusion: A Reality Check on AGI Myths\n\nKarpathy says this isn’t the year of agents . It’s the decade. Real agents need way more than a fancy wrapper on an LLM.\n\nThey need tool use, proper memory, multimodality, and the ability to learn over time. That’s a long, messy road.\n\nWe’re still in the “cute demo” phase, not the “fire your intern” era. So next time someone yells “Autonomy is here!”, remember, it is here the way flying cars were in 2005.\n\nReality: This decade is about slow, hard progress, not instant magic.\n\nThey can’t. Not even close.\n\nKarpathy is crystal clear on this. Today’s agents are brittle toys. They forget context, hallucinate steps , and struggle with anything beyond short tasks. Real interns adapt, plan, and learn over time.\n\nIn short, they still need their hand held.\n\nThe missing ingredients are big ones, like memory, multimodality, tool use, and autonomy. Until those are solved, calling them “intern replacements” is like calling autocorrect a novelist.\n\nReality: We’re nowhere near fully autonomous AI workers.\n\nKarpathy doesn’t mince words with what easily is one of the most popular AGI myths. Reinforcement Learning or RL is “sucking supervision through a straw.”\n\nWhen you only reward the final outcome, the model gets credit for every wrong turn it took to get there. That’s not learning, that’s noise dressed up as intelligence.\n\nRL works well for short, well-defined problems. But AGI needs structured reasoning, step-by-step feedback, and smarter credit assignment. That means process supervision, reflection loops, and better algorithms, and not just more reward hacking.\n\nReality: RL alone won’t power AGI. It’s too blunt a tool for something this complex.\n\nKarpathy busts this idea wide open. We’re not building animals. Animals learn through evolution, which means millions of years of trial, error, and survival.\n\nWe’re building ghosts. Models trained on a massive pile of internet text. That’s imitation, not instinct. These models don’t learn like brains; they optimize differently.\n\nSo no, one magical algorithm won’t turn an LLM into a human. Real AGI will need scaffolding – memory, tools, feedback, and structured loops – and not just a raw feed of data.\n\nReality: We’re not evolving creatures. We’re engineering systems.\n\nKarpathy argues that jamming endless facts into weights creates a hazy, unreliable memory. Models recall things fuzzily, not accurately. What matters more is the cognitive core, which is the reasoning engine underneath all that noise.\n\nInstead of turning models into bloated encyclopaedias, the smarter path is leaner cores with external retrieval , tool use, and structured reasoning. That’s how you build flexible intelligence, not a trivia machine with amnesia.\n\nReality: Intelligence comes from how models think, not how many facts they store.\n\nKarpathy calls coding the beachhead, i.e. the first real domain where AGI-style agents might work. Why? Because code is text. It’s structured, self-contained, and sits inside a mature infrastructure of compilers, debuggers, and CI/CD systems.\n\nOther domains like radiology or design don’t have that luxury. They’re messy, contextual, and harder to automate. That’s why code will lead and everything else will follow much, much slower.\n\nReality: Coding isn’t “just another domain.” It’s the front line of AGI deployment.\n\nKarpathy laughs at this one.\n\nA smooth demo doesn’t mean the technology is ready. A demo is a moment; a product is a marathon. Between them lies the dreaded march of nines, pushing reliability from 90% to 99.999%.\n\nThat’s where all the pain lives. Edge cases, latency, cost, safety, regulations, everything. Just ask the self-driving car industry.\n\nAGI won’t arrive through flashy demos. It’ll creep in through painfully slow productisation.\n\nReality: A working demo is the starting line, not the finish line.\n\nThis is a fan favourite. Big tech loves this line.\n\nKarpathy disagrees. He says AGI won’t flip the economy overnight. It’ll blend in slowly and steadily, just like electricity, smartphones, or the internet did.\n\nThe impact will be real, but diffused. Productivity won’t explode in a single year. It’ll seep into workflows, industries, and habits over time.\n\nThink silent revolution, not fireworks.\n\nReality: AGI will reshape the economy but through a slow burn, not a big bang.\n\nKarpathy isn’t buying this one.\n\nHe’s bullish on demand. The way he sees it, once useful AGI-like agents hit the market, they’ll soak up every GPU they can find. Coding tools, productivity agents, and synthetic data generation will drive massive compute use.\n\nYes, timelines are slower than the hype. But the demand curve? It’s coming. Hard.\n\nReality: We’re not overbuilding compute. We’re pre-building for the next wave.\n\nKarpathy calls this out directly.\n\nYes, scale mattered, but the race isn’t just about trillion-parameter giants anymore. In fact, state-of-the-art models are already getting smaller and smarter . Why? Because better datasets, smarter distillation, and more efficient architectures can achieve the same intelligence with less bloat.\n\nHe predicts the cognitive core of future AGI systems may live inside a ~1B parameter model. That’s a fraction of today’s trillion-parameter behemoths.\n\nReality: AGI won’t just be brute-forced through scale. It’ll be engineered through elegance.\n\nWhat we can safely take away from Andrej Karpathy’s insights is that AGI won’t arrive like a Hollywood plot twist. It’ll creep in quietly, reshaping workflows long before it reshapes the world. Karpathy’s take cuts through the noise and debunks the massive hue & cry around AI. There is no instant job apocalypse, no magic GDP spike, no trillion-parameter god model. All these are just popular myths around AGI.\n\nThe real story is slower. More technical. With more humans in the loop.\n\nThe future belongs not to the loudest predictions but to the quiet infrastructure, the coders, the systems, the cultural layers that make AGI practical.\n\nSo maybe the smartest move isn’t to bet on mythic AGI events.

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\nThe Hidden Limits of Single Vector Embeddings in Retrieval\n\nEmbedding-based retrieval, also known as dense retrieval, has become the go-to method for modern systems. Neural models map queries and documents to high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and retrieve documents by nearest-neighbor similarity. However, recent research shows a surprising weakness: single-vector embeddings have a fundamental capacity limit. In short, an embedding can only represent a certain number of distinct relevant document combinations. When queries require multiple documents as answers, dense retrievers start to fail, even on very simple tasks. In this blog, we will explore why this happens and examine the alternatives that can overcome these limitations.\n\nSingle-Vector Embeddings And Their Use In Retrieval\n\nTheoretical Limits of Single Vector Embeddings\n\nIn dense retrieval systems , a query is fed through a neural model to produce a single vector. This model is often a transformer or other language model. The produced vector captures the meaning of the text. For example, documents about sports will have vectors near each other. Meanwhile, a query like “best running shoes” will be close to shoe-related docs. At search time, the system encodes the user’s query into its embedding and finds the nearest document.\n\nTypically, the dot-product or cosine similarity returns the top-k similar documents. This differs from older sparse methods like BM25 that match keywords. Embedding models are famous for handling paraphrases and semantics. For example, searching “dog pictures” can find “puppy photographs” even if the words differ. These generalize well to new data because they leverage pre-trained language models.\n\nThese dense retrievers power many applications like web search engines, question answering systems, recommendation engines, and more. They also extend beyond plain text; multimodal embeddings map images or code to vectors, enabling cross-modal search.\n\nHowever, retrieval tasks have become more complex, especially tasks that combine multiple concepts or require returning multiple documents. A single vector embedding is not always able to handle queries. This brings us to a fundamental mathematical constraint that limits what single-vector systems can achieve.\n\nThe issue is a simple geometric fact. A fixed-size vector space can only realize a limited number of distinct ranking outcomes. Imagine you have n documents and you want to specify, for every query, which subset of k documents should be the top results. Each query can be thought of as picking some set of relevant docs. The embedding model translates each document into a point in ℝ^d. Also, each query becomes a point in the same space; the dot products determine relevance.\n\nIt can be shown that the minimum dimension d required to represent a given pattern of query-document relevance perfectly is determined by the matrix rank (or more specifically, the sign-rank) of the “relevance matrix,” indicating which docs are relevant to which queries.\n\nThe bottom line is that, for any particular dimension d, there are some possible query-document relevance patterns that a d-dimensional embedding cannot represent. In other words, no matter how you train or tune the model, if you ask for a sufficiently large number of distinct combinations of documents to be relevant together, a small vector cannot discriminate all those cases. In technical terms, the number of distinct top-k subsets of documents that can be produced by some query is upper-bounded by a function of d. Once the number of demands made by the query exceeds the ability to use the embedding to retrieve, some combinations can simply never be retrieved correctly.\n\nThis mathematical limitation explains why dense retrieval systems struggle with complex, multi-faceted queries that require understanding multiple independent concepts simultaneously. Fortunately, researchers have developed several architectural alternatives that can overcome these constraints.\n\nGiven these fundamental limitations of single-vector embeddings, several alternative approaches have emerged to address more complex retrieval scenarios:\n\nCross-Encoders (Re-Rankers): These models take the query and each document together and jointly score them, usually by feeding them as one sequence into a transformer. Because cross-encoders directly model interactions between query and doc, they are not limited by a fixed embedding dimension. But these are computationally expensive.\n\nMulti-Vector Models: These expand each document into multiple vectors. For example, ColBERT-style models index every token of a document separately, so a query can match on any combination of those vectors. This massively increases the effective representational capacity. Since each document is now a set of embeddings, the system can cover many more combination patterns. The trade-offs here are index size and design complexity. Multi-vector models often need a special retrieval index like Maximum Similarity or MaxSim, and can use a lot more storage.\n\nSparse Models: Sparse methods like BM25 represent text in very high-dimensional spaces, giving them strong capacity to capture diverse relevance patterns. They excel when queries and documents share terms, but their trade-off is heavy reliance on lexical overlap, making them weaker for semantic matching or reasoning beyond exact words.\n\nEach alternative has trade-offs, so many systems use hybrids: embeddings for fast retrieval, cross-encoders for re-ranking, or sparse models for lexical coverage. For complex queries, single-vector embeddings alone often fall short, making multi-vector or reasoning-based methods necessary.\n\nWhile dense embeddings have revolutionized information retrieval with their semantic understanding capabilities, they are not a universal solution, as the fundamental geometric constraints of single-vector representations create real limitations when dealing with complex, multi-faceted queries that require retrieving diverse combinations of documents. Understanding these limitations is crucial for building effective retrieval systems, and rather than viewing this as a failure of embedding-based methods, we should see it as an opportunity to design hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths of different approaches.\n\nThe future of retrieval lies not in any single method, but in intelligent combinations of dense embeddings, sparse representations, multi-vector models, and cross-encoders that can handle the full spectrum of information needs as AI systems become more sophisticated and user queries more complex.\n\nI am a Data Science Trainee at Analytics Vidhya, passionately working on the development of advanced AI solutions such as Generative AI applications, Large Language Models, and cutting-edge AI tools that push the boundaries of technology.

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\nWith Demo: How AI is Automating Car Servicing\n\nThis blog is based on a keynote delivered by Vignesh Kumar, AI Engineering Manager at Ford, during the Data Hack Summit 2025. His session, titled “Automating Vehicle Inspections with Multimodal AI”, explored how AI (artificial intelligence) is transforming the car servicing industry. It highlighted the scale of the challenge, the architecture of multimodal AI solutions , and the measurable business impact of deploying them at scale. What follows is a detailed exploration of that vision and its implications for the industry.\n\nTechnical Foundations of Multimodal AI\n\nHow the System Works in Practice\n\nDemo of eVHC in Action Key Features Core Capabilities Tech Stack\n\nThe car service world is no longer what it was a decade ago. Inspections used to be mechanical, manual, and heavily dependent on the eye of the technician. That era is fading. Customers today expect speed, clarity, and proof. They want to see what is wrong with their vehicle and why it needs fixing.\n\nThis is where electronic Vehicle Health Checks, or eVHCs, have become the industry’s answer. A short video of the car can highlight issues better than a sheet of paper ever could. It gives technicians a way to document problems. More importantly, it builds trust. When a customer can see worn brake pads or hear unusual noise, they no longer feel they are being sold repairs they do not need.\n\nThe shift to eVHCs has made transparency a competitive edge. But it has also created new challenges.\n\nThe adoption of video inspections has exploded. In 2024 alone, technicians produced 12.9 million service videos. With the help of platforms like CitNOW, that figure has already reached 80 million in a short span. The bigger picture is even more staggering: the global automotive repair and maintenance services market is projected to hit $1.91 trillion by 2032, with a 9.8% CAGR\n\nBut the surge in video data has a catch. Reviewing these videos manually is slow and inconsistent. Even the most skilled technicians cannot maintain the same level of detail when watching hundreds of clips daily. Turnaround times stretch. Costs rise. Customers wait longer. Ultimately, the customer trust weakens as and when quality wavers.\n\nThis is why automating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is the only way to match the pace of growth. AI can handle millions of hours of footage, assess clarity, extract insights, and deliver consistent results. And this is where multimodal AI jumps in.\n\nThe task of automating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is not as simple as pointing a camera and letting software run. The process demands intelligence across multiple data streams: video, audio, and text. This is where multimodal AI makes a difference.\n\nAt its core, the system follows a cloud-based workflow. A video is ingested, transformed, and then processed to generate structured outputs. Each step is designed to ensure nothing is lost in translation. A three-hour inspection video can be broken down into tokens – 66 tokens per frame for visual data, coupled with audio diarisation and language translation across 80+ tongues. The result is a time-ordered sequence that AI can analyse with precision.\n\nPrompt engineering sits at the heart of this architecture. The AI is not just asked to “analyse a video.” Instead, it is guided through a chain-of-thought reasoning process, role-based instructions, and conditional logic. The prompts are strict, sometimes demanding responses in structured JSON format. This rigidity ensures that the AI does not wander off script but produces consistent and verifiable results.\n\nTo safeguard quality, gatekeeper logic is applied early on. Before analysis begins, the system checks if the video is clear, if the car is visible, if the brand logo appears, and whether audio is present. Only then does the deeper inspection run. If any condition fails, the pipeline halts and generates a standardised response. This prevents wasted effort and keeps the workflow clean.\n\nThis layered design is why automating vehicle inspection with AI works wonders in practice. It does not rely on blind automation. It mirrors the structured, conditional way humans think, only at far greater speed and scale.\n\nAutomating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is a working pipeline that mirrors the way technicians think, but at scale.\n\nThe process begins with vehicle identification. The system confirms what car is being inspected. It checks for logos, number plates, and visible details to validate authenticity. Next comes audio presence verification. If the video has no sound, the inspection halts. Clear audio is crucial because technicians often explain faults while recording.\n\nThe AI also runs a clarity check. If the video is blurry or poorly lit, the system flags it as unusable. This prevents false results from creeping into reports. Only when these gatekeeper checks are passed does the deeper analysis begin.\n\nThe heart of the pipeline is brand classification and scoring. The system distinguishes between passenger and commercial vehicles. It then runs compliance checks against service protocols. Each inspection is scored on a 0-100 scale, capturing quality, completeness, and diagnostic accuracy. The results are precise and standardised, as the same car inspected in different locations will yield identical outputs.\n\nTo add to the effectiveness of the entire process, the entire video inspection is carried out with multilingual capability. With built-in transcription and translation, the AI can process commentary in over 80 languages. This ensures that service centres across geographies can maintain the same standards without barriers of language.\n\nThe final output is clean, structured, and ready for integration. It can be stored in a central database, sent as a customer-facing report, or fed into downstream workflows. The difference is immediate: what once took hours can now be done in minutes, with no compromise in quality.\n\nThe real measure of any AI solution lies in its outcomes. For automating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI, the results are striking.\n\nProcessing speed is the most visible gain. What once required hours of manual review is now 20 times faster. As per the data shared by Vignesh in his speech, each service location can save nearly 70 to 80 hours a month using such AI automation. That time can then be channelled back into customer engagement and core technical work rather than repetitive video checks.\n\nConsistency is another major advantage. Human reviews are prone to fatigue and error. AI pipelines do not tire. They maintain a uniform standard across dealerships, regions, and even countries. This is critical in an industry where brand trust depends on consistent service.\n\nThe customer impact is clear in numbers. Service centres using the system have recorded an 8.9-point improvement in Net Promoter Score (NPS). Each visit also generates 15% more value for the business. These are not abstract gains. They translate into higher customer satisfaction, repeat visits, and stronger lifetime value.\n\nScalability adds a third layer of impact. Traditional inspection models require exponential hiring to meet demand. AI, in contrast, scales linearly with costs. Whether it is one hundred or one million videos, the pipeline processes them at the same standard, 24/7.\n\nEven softer benefits matter. Faster inspections and transparent reports reduce disputes, as customers trust what they see. They return with confidence that their vehicle is in safe hands. In an industry driven by trust, this is perhaps the most lasting gain.\n\nAutomating vehicle inspection with AI is more than just about efficiency. It is about creating measurable, repeatable outcomes that strengthen both the business and the customer relationship.\n\nThe engine driving automated vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is not just the model, but the prompt architecture behind it. This is where Vignesh Kumar’s keynote revealed insights that go beyond cars and touch the core of AI practice.\n\nThe system does not rely on one generic prompt. It uses a five-step chain-of-thought design . Each step defines the role of the AI, the conditions it must check, the structured output it must generate, and the error handling it must follow. This creates a framework where responses are predictable, consistent, and verifiable.\n\nConditional logic plays a crucial role. A failed video check does not derail the system. Instead, the prompt redirects the model to produce a standardised fallback response. This branching structure mimics how humans handle exceptions: if one rule breaks, another takes over. This helps build resilience at scale.\n\nAnother innovation is non-linear prompt design. Instead of simply feeding data and waiting for results, the pipeline defines the desired output first. Only then does it layer in the conditions and rules that must be met. This approach gives the model a clear destination before it starts processing. It ensures that even when analysis is complex, the outputs remain aligned with expectations.\n\nPriority markers within prompts also help. For example, placing one or two asterisks before a keyword signals higher importance. This subtle cue shifts the model’s attention and improves reliability in complex evaluations.\n\nThese prompt strategies turn AI from a black box into a disciplined decision-maker. They show that the success of automating vehicle inspection with AI does not come from raw computational power alone. It comes from careful design that blends logic, control, and flexibility.\n\nThe keynote also showcased a working demo of an AI-powered Electronic Vehicle Health Check (eVHC). The project, built on Google Vertex AI’s gemini-2.5-pro, demonstrates how inspection videos can be analysed end-to-end without manual intervention.\n\nAI-Powered Analysis: Automatic inspection of vehicle videos, object detection, and condition checks\n\nStreamlined Insights: Generates structured summaries, diagnostic notes, and inspection scores\n\nScalable Automation: Processes large volumes of videos quickly and reliably\n\nVideo Management: URL extraction, downloading, and classification\n\nContent Analysis: Object recognition, condition assessment, and speech-to-text transcription\n\nData Handling: Validation, storage in Google BigQuery, and integration with Cloud Storage\n\nError Handling: Logging and standardised fallback responses\n\nGoogle BigQuery & Cloud Storage\n\nFastAPI (Backend) + React/Vite (Frontend)\n\nThis demo brings to life what automating vehicle inspection with AI means in practice. It shows that an inspection pipeline can be built, scaled, and deployed with open tools and cloud infrastructure.\n\nFull source code, documentation, and demo access are available on the GitHub repository here .\n\nAutomating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is still at an early stage, but the direction is clear. As inspection data multiplies, AI will not just support technicians; it will redefine their role.\n\nOne obvious path is global standardisation. Dealerships across regions will no longer depend on local practices or subjective judgments. An inspection video shot in Delhi can be evaluated by the same rules as one shot in Detroit. Consistency becomes a global asset instead of a local challenge.\n\nAnother future step lies in integration with broader mobility ecosystems. Inspection results can link directly with warranty claims, insurance processes, and predictive maintenance models. A video captured during a routine service could automatically update the digital twin of the vehicle, ensuring that every stakeholder, from insurers to OEMs, works from the same truth.\n\nThere is also scope for real-time analysis. Instead of waiting for post-service review, AI could guide technicians as they record. Prompts might signal if a car part is not clearly visible or if additional footage is needed. This transforms inspections from a one-way documentation process into an interactive loop that further raises accuracy.\n\nFinally, the long-term outlook includes cross-domain adoption. The same multimodal AI architecture can be applied in aviation maintenance, heavy machinery servicing, or even medical imaging. Anywhere complex systems require visual inspection, the lessons from automating vehicle inspection with AI can carry over.\n\nThe challenge ahead will not be technical alone. It will be about shaping responsible AI practices, ensuring that automation enhances human judgment rather than replacing it blindly. The automotive industry has a chance to lead here and to show how AI can bring trust, speed, and consistency to services that affect millions.\n\nThe keynote at Data Hack Summit 2025 made one thing clear: automating vehicle inspection for car servicing with AI is not a distant idea. It is already transforming how service centres operate, how customers experience trust, and how businesses measure outcomes.\n\nThe combination of multimodal analysis, structured prompt design, and quality gatekeeping has created a pipeline that works at scale. It handles millions of hours of video with consistency. It delivers insights in minutes, not days. And it does so while saving costs, boosting revenue, and strengthening customer satisfaction.\n\nFor an industry long criticised for opacity and inefficiency, this is a turning point. Inspection is no longer a bottleneck but a lever of trust. When a customer can see the same transparent report in any dealership, across any language, they know the process is fair. That is the kind of shift that shapes reputations.\n\nLooking forward, the challenge is to shape this future responsibly. AI cannot be allowed to replace human judgment without accountability. But as a tool for transparency, consistency, and efficiency, it is unmatched. The automotive world now has a chance to set the standard not only for its own sector, but for every industry that relies on visual inspection at scale.\n\nAutomating vehicle inspection with AI is not just a technical achievement. It is a cultural one. It shows how machines and humans, working together, can deliver more than either could alone. And it signals the road ahead, where trust, speed, and intelligence drive every service interaction.\n\nTechnical content strategist and communicator with a decade of experience in content creation and distribution across national media, Government of India, and private platforms\n\nExplore Generative AI for beginners: create text and images, use top AI tools, learn practical skills, and ethics.\n\nMaster Large Language Models (LLMs) with this course, offering clear guidance in NLP and model training made simple.\n\nThis free course guides you on building LLM apps, mastering prompt engineering, and developing chatbots with enterprise data.\n\nExplore practical solutions, advanced retrieval strategies, and agentic RAG systems to improve context, relevance, and accuracy in AI-driven applications.\n\nMaster MS Excel for data analysis with key formulas, functions, and LookUp tools in this comprehensive course.\n\nGPT-4 vs. Llama 3.1 – Which Model is Better?\n\nGPT-4 vs. Llama 3.1 – Which Model is Better?\n\nLlama-3.1-Storm-8B: The 8B LLM Powerhouse Surpa...\n\nLlama-3.1-Storm-8B: The 8B LLM Powerhouse Surpa...\n\nA Comprehensive Guide to Building Agentic RAG S...\n\nA Comprehensive Guide to Building Agentic RAG S...\n\nTop 10 Machine Learning Algorithms in 2025\n\nTop 10 Machine Learning Algorithms in 2025\n\n45 Questions to Test a Data Scientist on Basics...\n\n45 Questions to Test a Data Scientist on Basics...\n\n90+ Python Interview Questions and Answers (202...\n\n90+ Python Interview Questions and Answers (202...\n\n8 Easy Ways to Access ChatGPT for Free\n\n8 Easy Ways to Access ChatGPT for Free\n\nPrompt Engineering: Definition, Examples, Tips ...\n\nPrompt Engineering: Definition, Examples, Tips ...\n\nWhat is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n\nWhat is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n\nShare insights, grow your voice, and inspire the data community.\n\nShare Your Expertise with the World\n\nBuild Your Brand & Audience\n\nJoin a Thriving AI Community\n\nLevel Up Your AI Game\n\nExpand Your Influence in Genrative AI"

    "full_text": "Master Generative AI with 10+ Real-world Projects in 2025!\n\nHow Instagram leverages AI For Content Moderation?\n\nInstagram uses artificial intelligence (AI) extensively for filtering and content moderation to maintain a safe and positive user experience. The AI-powered systems automatically detect and remove content that violates Instagram’s Community Standards, such as hate speech, bullying, nudity, violence, and spam, before such posts are reported by users. This process involves a combination of machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies like convolutional neural networks. This article would attempt to shed some light on what goes on under the hood while Instagram maintains a positive and friendly user experience on its platform.\n\nAI Content Moderation on Instagram\n\nPersonalization and User Experience Enhancement\n\nAI Against Cyberbullying and Spam\n\nSummary of Techniques Used by Instagram\n\nWhat are the Benefits of AI Moderations\n\nChallenges and Limitations of AI Moderations\n\nInstagram’s AI systems automatically detect and remove content that violates its community guidelines, including hate speech, bullying, nudity, graphic violence, and spam, often before any user reports it.\n\nInstagram uses deep CNN classifiers to spot prohibited visuals. For example, it trains convolutional nets (often ResNet-style backbones) on large, labeled datasets of “inappropriate vs safe images”. It also uses object detection models (one-stage detectors like YOLO or two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN) to localize explicit content. Instagram’s parent company, Meta, notes that it can use YOLO for fast, real-time video scanning and Faster R-CNN, for example, with ResNet or ShuffleNet backbones when accuracy is paramount. In effect, CNN will flag an image if its pixels match patterns of nudity, weapons, graphic, and graphic violence.\n\n2. Optical Character Recognition (Rosetta):\n\nMany posts embed text like memes, screenshots, and images with captions, so Instagram uses a specialized OCR pipeline (Meta’s Rosetta system) to extract overlaid text. Then, Rosetta runs a Two-staged vision model, first a Faster R-CNN variant, which detects rectangular text regions, then a CNN based on Resnet-18 with CTC (sequences) loss, reads each word.\n\nFor example, a meme saying “1 like = 1 prayer” would be detected and transcribed. This text is fed into the moderation engine. Rosetta’s CNN+LSTM recognizer was trained on synthetic and real multilingual data, enabling Instagram to catch hate speech or spam hidden in the images.\n\nCaptions, comments, and messages are processed by natural-language models. Instagram applies algorithms, typically transformer-based text classifiers and RNNs, to score content against Community Guidelines.\n\nFor instance, comments are vectorized with learned embeddings or BERT-like models and fed to a spam/hate classifier. Abusive language, harassment, profanity, or hate is identified through learned patterns in text. While exact internal models are proprietary, Meta has shown it uses state-of-the-art NLP architecture to moderate dozens of languages at scale. In practice, posts flagged by either vision or NLP subsystem are either auto-blocked or sent to human review, depending on confidence.\n\nThis hybrid AI-human approach combines the speed and scale of AI with the nuanced decision-making of people, and feedback from human moderators is then used to retrain models, making the system smarter over time.\n\nInstagram’s feed, Explore tab, and Reels rely on ML ranking models to personalize each user’s experience. The system is a multi-stage recommender:\n\nFirst, it retrieves a large pool of candidate posts from followed accounts, trending tags, similar users’ posts, etc. Then it ranks them via deep learning. In retrieval, Instagram uses a Two-tower neural network, one “tower” processes user features like demographics, history, interests, and the other processes media features like post metadata, content embeddings.\n\nEach tower is typically a feedforward network, often starting from Word2Vec-like embeddings of IDs, that learns compact user/item vectors.  The training objective is to make the user and item embeddings close when the user interacts with the item. At serving time, the users’ tower and an approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) index (ex, using FAISS) produce thousands of candidate posts for ranking. This Two-Tower approach is highly cacheable and allows real-time retrieval from billions of items.\n\nOnce candidates are retrieved, Instagram applies a two-stage deep ranking model . The first stage ranker is a lightweight neural network that scores thousands of posts per user (often distilling knowledge from a heavier model. The second stage is a heavier multi-task multi-label neural network (MTML) that takes the top 100 candidates and predicts detailed engagement probabilities (click, like, comment, watch, etc.). This MTML model is a feedforward deep net trained via backprop that ingests rich features like user interests, post content vectors, past interaction metrics, etc., and multiple probabilities simultaneously. In short, a deep neural network handles both retrieval and final ranking of posts, allowing Instagram to sort feeds according to each user’s preferences. This personalization keeps engagement high by surfacing the most relevant content for each user.\n\nBeyond content and ranking, Instagram applies AI to fight spam bots and harassment. For example,\n\nSpam Detection: Accounts sending mass DMs or comments (like phishing scams) are flagged by pattern-learning models . Instagram can train binary classifiers like ensemble models or neural nets on features like posting frequency, message similarity, click rates, and account metadata. Any unnatural patterns like automated DMs, repeated links, or “like or like” schemes trigger anti-spam filters. Rosetta’s OCR also helps here; it can read spammy text in images/memes. Once flagged, accounts may be limited or removed.\n\nCyberbullying & harassment: NLP models watch conversation tone. Transformers or recurrent nets analyze the sentiment and context of comments or DMs. The system attempts to differentiate nasty content from benign banter, often using contextual embeddings. When a comment sounds abusive, it can be auto-filtered. Instagram has features like restricting or hiding words to use AI in preventing bullying. These language filters run continuously to block hate speech and harassment.\n\nCommunity Integrity : ML also prunes the recommendation graph: posts with many user reports or a history of violations may be downranked by content integrity signals. For example, during retrieval, Instagram applies business rules to drop objectionable posts from candidates. In proactive mode, after the main ranking score is computed, the system applies a final reranking filter, removing or demoting posts flagged by integrity checks.\n\nBy combining automated filters with human appeals, Instagram’s AI maintains safety and authenticity. It can nudge users to “Are you sure?” if a comment looks offensive. Collectively, these systems block millions of spammy or hateful interactions per day, protecting users and keeping the platform healthy.\n\nManual content moderation is not feasible for platforms with millions or billions of users who generate vast amounts of content every day. But with AI, it is possible to\n\nScales moderation to billions of posts daily.\n\nRemoves harmful content fast, often before anyone reports it.\n\nImproves safety, creating a more supportive community.\n\nPersonalizes experience and keeps content relevant and engaging.\n\nThese systems allow Instagram to handle a content volume that would be impossible for humans alone, improving both user and platform quality.\n\nEven the most advanced AI systems aren’t perfect. Instagram’s moderation faces a few challenges, like:\n\nFalse Positives: Artistic or educational nudity mistakenly flagged as a violation.\n\nFalse Negatives: Harmful content slipping through due to context or deliberate evasion, for example, using altered spellings or distorted images.\n\nBias and Fairness: Models can reflect human labeling biases, leading to uneven moderation across languages, cultures, or communities.\n\nTransparency : Users often don’t fully understand how moderation decisions are made, leading to frustration around “shadow bans” or post removals.\n\nInstagram’s AI is a comprehensive mix of computer vision, natural language processing, and large-scale recommendation models. State-of-the-art CNNs with architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, YOLO, and faster R-CNN handle image/video content. Advanced OCR (Rosetta) extracts text from memes to flag hidden violations. Concurrently, deep NLP models parse user text to catch hate speech or spam. On the other hand, neural recommender systems for the Two Tower retrieval and multi-tasking ranking networks continuously learn from user behavior to tailor each feed. This powerful AI-driven approach enables Instagram to moderate and personalize on a global scale. While issues like bias and explainability remain, these models are central to keeping Instagram safe, engaging, and relevant for its billions of users.\n\nA. Instagram uses AI models like CNNs, OCR (Rosetta), and NLP transformers to detect and remove hate speech, nudity, violence, and spam before users report it. These systems automatically flag, block, or send content for human review.\n\nA. Instagram’s feed and Explore tab rely on Two-Tower neural networks for retrieval and multi-task deep networks for ranking.

A misinterpreted prompt might make unintended changes to the code. The community asked for more control and improved management of non-text content. The engineering team responded with new features. The recent updates are mainly about safety, multimodal, and user experience.\n\nThe biggest change is Plan Mode. It shifts how the AI coding assistant will work with your codebase.\n\nBefore, the AI would apply changes directly. Now, Plan Mode adds a review step. When you provide a complicated task, the AI first produces an in-depth implementation plan. It explains exactly which files it will touch and what changes it will make.\n\nYou need to examine and authorize this plan. The AI will only act upon the changes once you positively confirm them. This conforms Qwen Code to the best software development practices. It provides you with complete control and does not allow for unintentional code overwrite. It transforms the AI from a loose order-taker coder to an active junior partner.\n\nAs per the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 76% of developers are currently or likely to use AI tools, yet accuracy and trust remain the most significant concerns. Plan Mode specifically addresses this lack of trust.\n\nCoding is not always text. It has UI designs, architecture diagrams, and error screenshots. Qwen Code fills this gap now with Vision Intelligence.\n\nThe model is now able to recognize when you’re giving image inputs. It auto-switches to the Qwen3-VL-Plus model. This model has a high visual reasoning ability. It has a huge context window.\n\nThis helps you to streamline your developer workflow quite heavily. You can send in a screenshot of the buggy webpage layout. The AI will be able to compare the visual output against your code to recommend fixes. It enhances frontend development and debugging effectively.\n\nThe updates also improve compatibility. Users of the Zed Code editor now have better authentication support. You can authenticate using OpenAI API keys or Qwen OAuth.\n\nAdditionally, the team included granular control options. You can now turn loop detection on and off to avoid having the AI become stuck. The software also includes an ask before overwrite prompt before the /init command deletes files. All these quality-of-life adjustments make Qwen Code a more reliable option for everyday use.\n\nLet’s talk no more, code yes. We will be installing the newest version of Qwen Code and trying Plan Mode and Vision Intelligence.\n\nYou must have Node.js on your system.\n\nYou must have a working API key for Qwen or a Qwen account at https://chat.qwen.ai/\n\nThen we need to install or update the tool. Open your terminal.\n\nOnce installed, navigate to your project directory. Initialize the tool and authenticate.\n\nLink your account by following the prompts on the screen. You may log in by using your Qwen account on https://chat.qwe n.ai/\n\nWe will use Plan Mode to reformat a Python script. Suppose we have a file called calc.py with ugly code.\n\nRather than having the AI simply correct it, we request a plan.\n\nExecute this command in your Qwen code:\n\nQwen Code did not alter the file. Rather, it prints a plan. The tool is now asking: Do you want to execute this plan? (Y/N) Type Y and press enter.\n\nNow, only the AI code assistant will change your file. This process makes sure you always know what is going on with your code.\n\nNow let’s test Vision Intelligence. We have a screenshot of the Homepage UI of Analytics Vidhya.\n\nWe would like Qwen Code to examine the image and recommend CSS changes for our style.css file.\n\nThe feature identifies the image file extension. It requests changing to the vision model. Then it is followed by providing the visual breakdown of AV.png .\n\nIt then suggests HTML, CSS, and JS code for what it finds in the image. This multimodal feature enables a smooth developer flow between design and code.\n\nThe produced webpage is not even near the Home page of Analytics Vidhya, but we must keep in mind that there are lots of UI components in the home page which we didn’t have, like images, font, etc. Then this output isn’t that bad. Nevertheless, some improvements are needed, like responsiveness, padding, and margin.\n\nThe community reaction to these updates has been positive. Developers appreciate the transparency of Plan Mode. The addition of Vision Intelligence opens new possibilities for frontend engineers.\n\nNo tool is, however, perfect. Users have complained about repeated problems with the tool not being able to read PDFs. The engineering team is also on GitHub and utilizes the feedback for future updates. Expect additional integration with other development environments and more fine-tuned control features soon.\n\nThe new releases to Qwen Code are a significant improvement. Plan Mode brings in the required safety rails for professional use. Vision Intelligence turns it into a true multimodal AI coding assistant. The features greatly bring the developer workflow into the modern age. With the blend of control and high-end AI capabilities, Alibaba Cloud has made an attractive tool. We strongly urge developers to download the latest iteration and try these features out for themselves.\n\nA. Plan Mode allows the AI to create a step-by-step plan for code updates. You need to approve and review this plan prior to the AI altering any files.\n\nA. When image inputs are detected, the tool will automatically switch to the Qwen3-VL-Plus model for visual data analysis.\n\nA. Yes, recent updates were enhancing Zed integration. It can now authenticate using both OpenAI API keys and Qwen OAuth.\n\nHarsh Mishra is an AI/ML Engineer who spends more time talking to Large Language Models than actual humans.
